#### Two questions you may have:

1. [How and why do I acquire a machine?](#heading--acquire)
2. [How do I deploy a machine?](#heading--deploy)

The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a "cloud" resource, then [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju) is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.

<a href="#heading--acquire"><h2 id="heading--acquire">Acquire</h2></a>

Acquiring ("allocating") a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju).

Before deploying a machine, MAAS must acquire it (status 'Allocated'). When deploying from the web UI, this action is performed automatically (and invisibly).

The action remains useful in terms of reserving a machine for later use. To acquire a machine explicitly select the machine and apply the 'Acquire' action.

<!-- snap-2-7-ui snap-2-8-ui snap-2-9-ui deb-2-7-ui deb-2-8-ui deb-2-9-ui
To acquire/allocate a node with the web UI, select a machine which is in the "Ready" state, and drop down the "Take action" menu:

Select "Acquire" from the drop-down menu, which will bring you to a confirmation screen:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg"></a>

MAAS will acquire the selected machine; you can now find it in the list of "Allocated" machines:

<a href="#heading--deploy"><h2 id="heading--deploy">Deploy</h2></a>

To deploy, you must configure the underlying machine to netboot.  Such a machine will undergo the following process:

1.  DHCP server is contacted
2.  kernel and initrd are received over TFTP
3.  machine boots
4.  initrd mounts a Squashfs image ephemerally over HTTP
5.  cloud-init triggers deployment process
6.  curtin installation script runs
7.  Squashfs image (same as above) is placed on disk

Before deploying, you should take two key actions:

1.   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](/t/ubuntu-kernels/3180) and the [Kernel boot options](/t/kernel-boot-options/2784) that will get used by deployed machines.

While a machine is deploying its status will change to Deploying to 'OS', where 'OS' is the name of the OS being deployed (e.g. 'Deploying to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS').

Once a machine has finished deploying its status will change to just the name of the OS (e.g. 'Ubuntu 18.04 LTS').
