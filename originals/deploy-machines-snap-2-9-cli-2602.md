#### Quick questions you may have:

* [How and why do I acquire a machine?](#heading--acquire)
* [How do I deploy a machine?](#heading--deploy)

The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a "cloud" resource, then [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju) is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.

<h2 id="heading--acquire">Acquire</h2>

Acquiring ("allocating") a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju).

Before deploying a machine, MAAS must acquire it (status 'Allocated'). When deploying from the web UI, this action is performed automatically (and invisibly).

The action remains useful in terms of reserving a machine for later use. To acquire a machine explicitly select the machine and apply the 'Acquire' action.

<!-- snap-2-7-ui snap-2-8-ui snap-2-9-ui deb-2-7-ui deb-2-8-ui deb-2-9-ui
To acquire/allocate a node with the web UI, select a machine which is in the "Ready" state, and drop down the "Take action" menu:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg"></a>

Select "Acquire" from the drop-down menu, which will bring you to a confirmation screen:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg"></a>

MAAS will acquire the selected machine; you can now find it in the list of "Allocated" machines:

To acquire/allocate a random node:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE machines allocate
```

To acquire/allocate a specific node:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE machines allocate system_id=$SYSTEM_ID
```


[note]
To acquire a node, it must have a status of 'Ready'.

<h2 id="heading--deploy">Deploy</h2>

To deploy, you must configure the underlying machine to netboot.  Such a machine will undergo the following process:

1.  DHCP server is contacted
2.  kernel and initrd are received over TFTP
3.  machine boots
4.  initrd mounts a Squashfs image ephemerally over HTTP
5.  cloud-init triggers deployment process
    1.  curtin installation script runs
    2.  Squashfs image (same as above) is placed on disk

<!-- deb-2-7-cli
[note]
The curtin installer uses an image-based method and is now the only installer used by MAAS. Although the older debian-installer method has been removed, curtin continues to support preseed files. For more information about customising machines see [Custom machine setup](/t/custom-machine-setup/2592).
[/note]

Before deploying, you should:

-   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](/t/ubuntu-kernels/3180) and the [Kernel boot options](/t/kernel-boot-options/2784) that will get used by deployed machines.
-   ensure any pertinent SSH keys are imported (see [SSH keys](/t/user-accounts/3204#heading--ssh-keys)) to MAAS so it can connect to deployed machines.

Before deploying, you should:

-   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](/t/ubuntu-kernels/3183) and the [Kernel boot options](/t/kernel-boot-options/2787) that will get used by deployed machines.
-   ensure any pertinent SSH keys are imported (see [SSH keys](/t/user-accounts/3207#heading--ssh-keys)) to MAAS so it can connect to deployed machines.

To deploy directly from MAAS, select one or more machine(s) and press the 'Deploy' button.

<a href="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/56958753-nodes-deploy__2.4_deploy.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/56958753-nodes-deploy__2.4_deploy.png"></a>

You then have the option of deviating from the default OS, release, and kernel. When ready, press 'Deploy X machine(s)' (where 'X' is the number of machines selected).

While a machine is deploying its status will change to Deploying to 'OS', where 'OS' is the name of the OS being deployed (e.g. 'Deploying to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS').

Once a machine has finished deploying its status will change to just the name of the OS (e.g. 'Ubuntu 18.04 LTS').

To deploy a node:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID
```

To deploy a node as a KVM host:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID install_kvm=True
```

[note]
To deploy with the CLI, the node must have a status of 'Allocated'. See 'Acquire a node' above.
