Once you've successfully installed MAAS (regardless of method), you can login to the MAAS CLI via the following process.  First, generate the API-key for the user you're going to employing:

```
sudo maas apikey --username=$PROFILE > api-key-file
```

Replace $PROFILE with whatever username you set during the `createadmin` part of the install process.  Next, login with the following command:

```
maas login $PROFILE $MAAS_URL < api-key-file
```

Substitute $MAAS_URL with the URL that was returned to you when you initialised MAAS, for example, `192.168.43.251:5240/MAAS`.  Remember that, once you've logged in, you can get extensive CLI help with the command:

```
maas admin --help
```

Sample output is shown in the detail section below.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

Configuring MAAS consists of four broad steps:

1. Setting upstream DNS
2. Importing an SSH key for your admin user
3. Importing images
4. Configuring DNS

This section will cover those four operations

<h3>Setting DNS</h3>

After logging in for the first time, you will need to set a number of system-wide configuration options.  First up, you should configure DNS.  You can check out the help for DNS settings, known in the CLI as a "DNS forwarder":

```
maas $PROFILE maas set-config name=upstream_dns value="8.8.8.8"
```

Here, we've set the DNS forwarder to "8.8.8.8" (Google), which is a reliable value.

<h3>Setting SSH for the admin user</h3>

To add a public SSH key to a MAAS user account, type the following command:

```
maas $PROFILE sshkeys create "key=$SSH_KEY"
```

<h3>Importing images</h3>

Before going any further, it's worthwhile to start the image import, as it can sometimes take a few minutes.  You can see what images you already have downloaded with this command:

```
maas $PROFILE boot-resources read | jq -r '.[] | "\(.name)\t\(.architecture)"'
```

This command will return a list similar to the following:

```
grub-efi-signed/uefi        amd64/generic
grub-efi/uefi           arm64/generic
grub-ieee1275/open-firmware ppc64el/generic
pxelinux/pxe            i386/generic
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/ga-18.04
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/ga-18.04-lowlatency
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-edge
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-lowlatency
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-lowlatency-edge
```

Suppose you also want a version called "Trusty" -- you can import a new image by first selecting it for download, like this:

```
maas $PROFILE boot-source-selections create 1 \ > os="ubuntu" release="trusty" arches="amd64" subarches="*" \ > labels="*"
```

which returns some JSON confirming your action:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "release": "trusty",
    "arches": [
        "amd64"
    ],
    "subarches": [
        "*"
    ],
    "labels": [
        "*"
    ],
    "boot_source_id": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/boot-sources/1/selections/2/"
}
```
Once selected, you can start the image import with this command:

```
maas admin boot-resources import
```

which offers a shorter confirmation message:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
Import of boot resources started
```

<h3>Enabling DHCP</h3>

Once your image has been imported, you'll want to get DHCP working, which means finding the untagged VLAN. In truth, it shouldn’t be too hard, because at this point, there still should only be one.

In order to turn on DHCP, you need to know two things besides the VLAN name (“untagged”): the fabric ID and the primary rack controller name. To start, all the fabrics will be on the same untagged VLAN, so any fabric will do. You can find a valid fabric ID by reading it from any subnet, so just pick one  (e.g., 192.168.123.0/24) and find a usable fabric ID like this:

```
maas $PROFILE subnet read $SUBNET_CIDR | grep fabric_id
```

which returns (in this example):

```
"fabric_id": $FABRIC_ID,
```

Next, find the name of the primary rack controller. It's usually fairly obvious, but for purposes of argument, assume that it's not known. You can get it this way:

```
maas $PROFILE rack-controllers read | grep hostname | cut -d '"' -f 4
```

This returns a hostname, which we'll call:

```
$RACK_CONTR_HOSTNAME
```

Finally, you need to create an IP range for DHCP, in this case, a dynamic range:

```
maas $PROFILE ipranges create type=dynamic start_ip=$START_IP end_ip=$END_IP
```

This command returns something similar to this sample output:

    Success.
    Machine-readable output follows:
    {
        "subnet": {
            "name": "192.168.123.0/24",
            "description": "",
            "vlan": {
                "vid": 0,
                "mtu": 1500,
                "dhcp_on": false,
                "external_dhcp": null,
                "relay_vlan": null,
                "fabric": "fabric-2",
                "primary_rack": null,
                "name": "untagged",
                "id": 5003,
                "space": "undefined",
                "secondary_rack": null,
                "fabric_id": 2,
                "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/vlans/5003/"
            },
            "cidr": "192.168.123.0/24",
            "rdns_mode": 2,
            "gateway_ip": null,
            "dns_servers": [],
            "allow_dns": true,
            "allow_proxy": true,
            "active_discovery": false,
            "managed": true,
            "id": 4,
            "space": "undefined",
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/subnets/4/"
        },
        "type": "dynamic",
        "start_ip": "192.168.123.190",
        "end_ip": "192.168.123.253",
        "user": {
            "is_superuser": true,
            "username": "admin",
            "email": "admin@admin.com",
            "is_local": true,
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/users/admin/"
        },
        "comment": "",
        "id": 1,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/ipranges/1/"
    }

So you should now be able to turn on DHCP like this:

```
maas $PROFILE vlan update $FABRIC_ID untagged dhcp_on=True primary_rack=$RACK_CONTR_HOSTHNAME
```

If you've done everything correctly, you should see JSON output similar to this sample:

    Success.
    Machine-readable output follows:

Once you've successfully installed MAAS (regardless of method), you can now login here:

http://${API_HOST}:5240/MAAS

where $API_HOST is the hostname or IP address of the region API server, which was set during installation.  You will see a screen like this:</p>

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/efd8e3f150dfec28114c452c12e24e320848e075.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/efd8e3f150dfec28114c452c12e24e320848e075.jpeg"></a> 

Log in at the prompts, with the login information you created when initialising MAAS.

<h2 id="heading--configuration">Configuration</h2>

After a fresh MAAS installation, the web UI presents a couple of welcome  screens.  From these screens, you can set many system-wide options, including connectivity, image downloads, and authentication keys.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/337aa15e178b14b0ba9a0646953268bf7adac0bb.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/337aa15e178b14b0ba9a0646953268bf7adac0bb.jpeg"></a>  

Your main concerns for this experiment are the DNS forwarder, the Ubuntu image import section, and the SSH public key, though you might want to set the region name to something memorable, since this text will appear at the bottom of every MAAS screen in this install domain. Set the DNS forwarder to something obvious, e.g., `8.8.8.8`, Google’s DNS server.  Set this to your own internal DNS server if you know the IP address.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/f9751eb857dcd0c124783edeb1aaf87b8b538127.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/f9751eb857dcd0c124783edeb1aaf87b8b538127.jpeg"></a>  

Select an Ubuntu image to import, noting that you may be required to select at least one LTS version, depending upon the version of MAAS that snap installed.  In this example, we've already chosen an image, and downloading is partially complete.

When you click on “Continue,” the screen will shift to a screen labelled, “SSH keys for admin:”  

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dbdcdce7c8f3b7181f894bdfe987758e0c8635fc.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dbdcdce7c8f3b7181f894bdfe987758e0c8635fc.jpeg"></a> 

In the source drop-down, select “Launchpad,” “Github,” or “Upload.”  If you choose one of the first two, you will need to enter your username for that service.  For example, if you want to upload your SSH public key from Launchpad, you would enter:

    lp:<username>


<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0e4cbf7c8fae3f21664a4d5fe8d0f90785dd6859.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0e4cbf7c8fae3f21664a4d5fe8d0f90785dd6859.jpeg"></a> 

Likewise, if you want to upload your github public SSH key, you would enter:

    gh:<username>

If you want to use your existing public key from your home directory, you can select “Upload”and then copy your entire public key from <code>.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> (or wherever you may have stored the key):

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a94f1f68db07dd9be9e8eaed50f22828c7bb51e0.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a94f1f68db07dd9be9e8eaed50f22828c7bb51e0.jpeg"></a> 

and paste it into the block labelled “Public key.”  Finally, press the “Import” button to import this key:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/ab62bf22308343988016189fbbb851c44caf2e33.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/ab62bf22308343988016189fbbb851c44caf2e33.jpeg"></a> 

With this complete, you’ll see that MAAS has been successfully set up. Click ‘Go to the Dashboard’ to proceed.

<h3 id="heading--spaces-fabrics-zones-and-subnets">Spaces, fabrics, zones and subnets</h3>

Networks in large data centres can be very complex. MAAS offers comprehensive control over networking so that you have the flexibility to reconfigure racks and deploy machines as you see fit. You can isolate machine deployment not only with DNS domains, but also via [subnets](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#heading--subnets), [spaces](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#heading--spaces), [zones](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#heading--zones), and [fabrics](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#heading--fabrics).  The links provide more details, but these are all basically collections:

* **subnet** has the traditional meaning: a range of IP addresses covering a subset of IP addresses.  Generally speaking , a subnet is a collection of IP addresses which includes at least two addresses.
* a **space** is a collection of subnets that you can create with MAAS, understanding that each subnet can belong to only one space.  Spaces allow multiple subnets to communicate without requiring a direct network path between them.
* a **zone** is also an ad-hoc collection, but one which groups individual nodes, rather than subnets.  MAAS allows you to create and edit zones at will.
* a **fabric** is essentially a collection of trunked switches, allowing you to access a group of VLANs.

Here is a diagram that helps to illustrate these concepts:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dd60fdeba34d3cf33d4cf42db1f745ba95542b69.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dd60fdeba34d3cf33d4cf42db1f745ba95542b69.jpeg"></a> 

<!-- snap-2-7-ui snap-2-8-ui snap-2-9-ui deb-2-7-ui deb-2-8-ui deb-2-9-ui
Be aware that these network settings are spread across several web UI configuration pages. The Zones page, for example, enables you to see how many machines, devices and controllers are using a zone, and allows you to add and edit zones.  The Subnets page, shown below, provides access to fabric, VLAN, subnet and spaces configuration.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/89d90a15e70a57e6951ee62910b503895e08251e.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/89d90a15e70a57e6951ee62910b503895e08251e.jpeg"></a> 

<h2 id="heading--deploy-hardware">Deployment</h2>

MAAS-managed machines are listed – and operated on – from the Machines page, making it one of the most important screens in the MAAS web UI:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/58a37e0dc29bc233f771c33d07a0e03e8d55cb87.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/58a37e0dc29bc233f771c33d07a0e03e8d55cb87.jpeg"></a> 

If you are testing MAAS using virtual machines, the machines appear here as soon as they boot. New machines are added automatically when they first connect to your network. Alternatively, the ‘Add hardware’ menu lets you add machines manually, via their MAC address.

After you configure power and interfaces, MAAS must commission machines to retrieve CPU, memory and storage information. From this point, you can command MAAS to acquire, test, deploy and release these machines as you work with your MAAS cloud.

After you create a VM host, you compose hardware by selecting the VM host, and then selecting "Compose" from the Action menu. You can configure composed hardware as desired, including the number of cores, CPU speed, RAM and combined storage.  Then just click "Compose machine", and MAAS will combine resources to create a new, single entity that can be used just like any other machine.  VM hosts abstract multiple resources:
