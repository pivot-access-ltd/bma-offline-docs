<h4>Quick questions you may have:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="#heading--acquire">How and why do I acquire a machine?</a></li>
<li><a href="#heading--deploy">How do I deploy a machine?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; resource, then <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju">Juju</a> is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.</p>

<h2 id="heading--acquire">Acquire</h2>

<p>Acquiring (&ldquo;allocating&rdquo;) a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju">Juju</a>.</p>
<p>Before deploying a machine, MAAS must acquire it (status &lsquo;Allocated&rsquo;). When deploying from the web UI, this action is performed automatically (and invisibly).</p>
<p>The action remains useful in terms of reserving a machine for later use. To acquire a machine explicitly select the machine and apply the &lsquo;Acquire&rsquo; action.</p>
<!-- snap-2-7-ui snap-2-8-ui snap-2-9-ui deb-2-7-ui deb-2-8-ui deb-2-9-ui
To acquire/allocate a node with the web UI, select a machine which is in the "Ready" state, and drop down the "Take action" menu:

<a href="images/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="images/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg"></a></a>

Select "Acquire" from the drop-down menu, which will bring you to a confirmation screen:

<a href="images/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="images/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg"></a></a>

MAAS will acquire the selected machine; you can now find it in the list of "Allocated" machines:

<a href="images/a2bdb8b7b7c5705daee14bdea5caed223537917d.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="images/a2bdb8b7b7c5705daee14bdea5caed223537917d.jpeg"></a></a>

</code></pre>

<p>To acquire/allocate a specific node:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE machines allocate system_id=$SYSTEM_ID
</code></pre>

<p>[note]
To acquire a node, it must have a status of &lsquo;Ready&rsquo;.
[/note]</p>
<h2 id="heading--deploy">Deploy</h2>

<p>To deploy, you must configure the underlying machine to netboot.  Such a machine will undergo the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>DHCP server is contacted</li>
<li>kernel and initrd are received over TFTP</li>
<li>machine boots</li>
<li>initrd mounts a Squashfs image ephemerally over HTTP</li>
<li>cloud-init triggers deployment process<ol>
<li>curtin installation script runs</li>
<li>Squashfs image (same as above) is placed on disk</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- deb-2-7-cli
[note]
The curtin installer uses an image-based method and is now the only installer used by MAAS. Although the older debian-installer method has been removed, curtin continues to support preseed files. For more information about customising machines see [Custom machine setup](custom-machine-setup.html).

-   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](ubuntu-kernels.html) and the [Kernel boot options](kernel-boot-options.html) that will get used by deployed machines.
-   ensure any pertinent SSH keys are imported (see [SSH keys](user-accounts.html#heading--ssh-keys)) to MAAS so it can connect to deployed machines.

To deploy directly from MAAS, select one or more machine(s) and press the 'Deploy' button.

<a href="images/56958753-nodes-deploy__2.4_deploy.png" target = "_blank"><img src="images/56958753-nodes-deploy__2.4_deploy.png"></a></a>

You then have the option of deviating from the default OS, release, and kernel. When ready, press 'Deploy X machine(s)' (where 'X' is the number of machines selected).

<a href="images/d65b9884-nodes-deploy__2.6-deploy-confirm.png" target = "_blank"><img src="images/d65b9884-nodes-deploy__2.6-deploy-confirm.png"></a></a>

While a machine is deploying its status will change to Deploying to 'OS', where 'OS' is the name of the OS being deployed (e.g. 'Deploying to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS').

Once a machine has finished deploying its status will change to just the name of the OS (e.g. 'Ubuntu 18.04 LTS').
