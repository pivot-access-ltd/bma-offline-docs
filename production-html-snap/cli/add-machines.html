      <h1>Add machines</h1><p>||2.9|3.0|</p>
<p>There are two ways to add a machine to MAAS:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you place the machine on a connected network, and the machine is configured to netboot, MAAS will automatically enlist it.</li>
<li>If you add a machine manually, MAAS will automatically commission it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will explain more about both methods.</p>

<p>MAAS typically adds a machine via a combination of DHCP, TFTP, and PXE. By now, you should have enabled MAAS to automatically add devices and machines to your environment. This unattended method of adding machines is called enlistment.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> 
Configuring a computer to boot over PXE is done via its BIOS, often referred to as &ldquo;netboot&rdquo; or &ldquo;network boot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Regardless of how MAAS adds a machine, there are no special requirements for the underlying machine. In particular, there is no need to install an operating system on it.</p>
<p>Once MAAS is working to the point of adding machines, you&rsquo;ll probably want to understand statuses and actions. See <a href="concepts-and-terms.html#heading--node-statuses">Node statuses</a> and <a href="concepts-and-terms.html#heading--machine-actions">Machine actions</a> respectively.</p>
<p><a href="#heading--enlistment"><h2 id="heading--enlistment">How enlistment works</h2></a></p>
<p>When MAAS enlists a machine, it first contacts the DHCP server, so that the machine can be assigned an IP address.  An IP address is necessary to download a kernel and initrd via TFTP, since these functions can&rsquo;t accept domain names.  Once the machine has a bootable kernel, MAAS boots it:</p>

<p>Next, initrd mounts a Squashfs image, ephemerally via HTTP, so that cloud-init can execute:</p>

<p>Finally, cloud-init runs enlistment and setup scripts:</p>

3. **Architecture**: This field refers to the architecture of the machine being added.

4. **Minimum Kernel**: This field supplies a drop-down of possible kernels available for deployment on this machine.

5. **Zone**: This field allows you to set the availability zone, selected from AZs that you have already created (if any).

6. **Resource pool**: This field allows you to set the resource pool for this machine, selected from pools you have already created (if any).

<p>Normally, when you add a machine manually, MAAS will immediately attempt to commission the machine. Note that you will need to configure the underlying machine to boot over the network, or commissioning will fail. MAAS cannot handle this configuration for you.  While the correct method for configuring network boot depends heavily on your server, there are two common elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The network card on your server must be able to support PXE, i.e., your NIC &ndash; whether independent or integrated on a motherboard &ndash; must have a boot PROM that supports network booting.  You&rsquo;ll need to consult the documentation for the machine in question to determine this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You usually have to interrupt the boot process and enter the BIOS/UEFI menu to configure the network card&rsquo;s PXE stack.  Again, you may need to consult your machine&rsquo;s documentation to pin down this step.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional steps will vary widely by machine type and architecture.</p>
<p><a href="#heading--bmc-enlistment"><h3 id="heading--bmc-enlistment">BMC enlistment</h3></a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> 
Note that in MAAS versions before 2.5, you are required to provide the MAC address of the PXE interface when adding a new machine manually.</p>
<h5>IPMI machines</h5>
<p>For IPMI machines, you only need to provide IPMI credentials. MAAS automatically discovers the machine and runs enlistment configuration by matching the BMC address.</p>
<h5>Non-IPMI machines</h5>
<p>For non-IPMI machines, you must specify a non-PXE MAC address. MAAS automatically discovers the machine and runs enlistment configuration by matching the non-PXE MAC address.</p>

<p><a href="#heading--disable-individual-boot-methods"><h2 id="heading--disable-individual-boot-methods">How do I disable individual boot methods?</h2></a></p>
<p>In MAAS 3.0, it is possible to diable individual boot methods.  This must be done via the CLI. When a boot method is disabled MAAS will configure MAAS controlled <code>isc-dhcpd</code> to not respond to the associated <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#processor-architecture">boot architecture code</a>. External DHCP servers must be configured manually.</p>
<p>To allow different boot methods to be in different states on separate physical networks using the same VLAN ID configuration is done on the subnet in the UI or API. When using the API boot methods to be disabled may be specified using the MAAS internal name or <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#processor-architecture">boot architecture code</a> in octet or hex form. For example the following disabled i386/AMD64 PXE, AMD64 UEFI TFTP, and AMD64 UEFI HTTP</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE subnet \
update $SUBNET \
disabled_boot_architectures=&quot;0x00 uefi_amd64_tftp 00:10&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Specifically, for MAAS 3.0, the following changes have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>UEFI AMD64 HTTP(00:10) has been reenabled.</li>
<li>UEFI ARM64 HTTP(00:13) has been enabled.</li>
<li>UEFI ARM64 TFTP(00:0B) and UEFI ARM64 HTTP(00:13) will now provide a shim and GRUB signed with the Microsoft boot loader keys.</li>
<li>grub.cfg for all UEFI platforms has been updated to replace the deprecated <code>linuxefi</code> and <code>initrdefi</code> commands with the standard <code>linux</code> and <code>initrd</code> commands.</li>
<li>GRUB debug may now be enabled by enabling <a href="running-installed-maas-in-debug-logging-mode.html">rackd debug logging</a>.</li>
