<h4>Two questions you may have:</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="#heading--acquire">How and why do I acquire a machine?</a></li>
<li><a href="#heading--deploy">How do I deploy a machine?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; resource, then <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju">Juju</a> is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.</p>

<p><a href="#heading--acquire"><h2 id="heading--acquire">Acquire</h2></a></p>
<p>Acquiring (&ldquo;allocating&rdquo;) a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju">Juju</a>.</p>
<p>Before deploying a machine, MAAS must acquire it (status &lsquo;Allocated&rsquo;). When deploying from the web UI, this action is performed automatically (and invisibly).</p>
<p>The action remains useful in terms of reserving a machine for later use. To acquire a machine explicitly select the machine and apply the &lsquo;Acquire&rsquo; action.</p>
<p>To acquire/allocate a node with the web UI, select a machine which is in the &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; state, and drop down the &ldquo;Take action&rdquo; menu:</p>
<p><a href="images/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="images/3724346e052c865f4e865d1caf2778b115f0798f.jpeg"></a></a></p>
<p>Select &ldquo;Acquire&rdquo; from the drop-down menu, which will bring you to a confirmation screen:</p>
<p><a href="images/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="images/a0ece8bf58c03db3c89ad71afcaeb9101bd34e24.jpeg"></a></a></p>
<p>MAAS will acquire the selected machine; you can now find it in the list of &ldquo;Allocated&rdquo; machines:</p>

To acquire a node, it must have a status of &lsquo;Ready&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="#heading--deploy"><h2 id="heading--deploy">Deploy</h2></a></p>
<p>To deploy, you must configure the underlying machine to netboot.  Such a machine will undergo the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>DHCP server is contacted</li>
<li>kernel and initrd are received over TFTP</li>
<li>machine boots</li>
<li>initrd mounts a Squashfs image ephemerally over HTTP</li>
<li>cloud-init triggers deployment process</li>
<li>curtin installation script runs</li>
<li>Squashfs image (same as above) is placed on disk</li>
</ol>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> 
The curtin installer uses an image-based method and is now the only installer used by MAAS. Although the older debian-installer method has been removed, curtin continues to support preseed files. For more information about customising machines see [Custom machine setup](custom-machine-setup.html).

Before deploying, you should take two key actions:

1.   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](ubuntu-kernels.html) and the [Kernel boot options](kernel-boot-options.html) that will get used by deployed machines.
2.   ensure any pertinent SSH keys are imported (see [SSH keys](user-accounts.html#heading--ssh-keys)) to MAAS so it can connect to deployed machines.

<p>To deploy directly from MAAS, select one or more machine(s) and press the &lsquo;Deploy&rsquo; button.</p>

<p>You then have the option of deviating from the default OS, release, and kernel. When ready, press &lsquo;Deploy X machine(s)&rsquo; (where &lsquo;X&rsquo; is the number of machines selected).</p>

<p>While a machine is deploying its status will change to Deploying to &lsquo;OS&rsquo;, where &lsquo;OS&rsquo; is the name of the OS being deployed (e.g. &lsquo;Deploying to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Once a machine has finished deploying its status will change to just the name of the OS (e.g. &lsquo;Ubuntu 18.04 LTS&rsquo;).</p>

To deploy a node:

<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID
</code></pre>


To deploy a node as a KVM host:


<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID install_kvm=True
</code></pre>


<strong>NOTE:</strong> 
To deploy with the CLI, the node must have a status of 'Allocated'. See 'Acquire a node' above.
