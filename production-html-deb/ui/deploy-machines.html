<h4>Two questions you may have:</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="#heading--acquire">How and why do I acquire a machine?</a></li>
<li><a href="#heading--deploy">How do I deploy a machine?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; resource, then <a href="https://jaas.ai/">Juju</a> is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.</p>

<p><a href="#heading--acquire"><h2 id="heading--acquire">Acquire</h2></a></p>
<p>Acquiring (&ldquo;allocating&rdquo;) a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as Juju.</p>
<p>Before deploying a machine, MAAS must acquire it (status &lsquo;Allocated&rsquo;). When deploying from the web UI, this action is performed automatically (and invisibly).</p>
<p>The action remains useful in terms of reserving a machine for later use. To acquire a machine explicitly select the machine and apply the &lsquo;Acquire&rsquo; action.</p>
<p>To acquire/allocate a node with the web UI, select a machine which is in the &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; state, and drop down the &ldquo;Take action&rdquo; menu:</p>

<p>Select &ldquo;Acquire&rdquo; from the drop-down menu, which will bring you to a confirmation screen:</p>

<p>To deploy, you must configure the underlying machine to netboot.  Such a machine will undergo the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>DHCP server is contacted</li>
<li>kernel and initrd are received over TFTP</li>

The curtin installer uses an image-based method and is now the only installer used by MAAS. Although the older debian-installer method has been removed, curtin continues to support preseed files. For more information about customising machines see [Custom machine setup](custom-machine-setup.html).

Before deploying, you should take two key actions:

1.   review and possibly set the [Ubuntu kernels](ubuntu-kernels.html) and the [Kernel boot options](kernel-boot-options.html) that will get used by deployed machines.
2.   ensure any pertinent SSH keys are imported (see [SSH keys](user-accounts.html#heading--ssh-keys)) to MAAS so it can connect to deployed machines.

To deploy a node:

<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID
</code></pre>


To deploy a node as a KVM host:


<pre><code class="bash">maas $PROFILE machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID install_kvm=True
</code></pre>


<strong>NOTE:</strong> 
To deploy with the CLI, the node must have a status of 'Allocated'. See 'Acquire a node' above.


<a href="#heading--configure-deployment-timeout"><h3 id="heading--configure-deployment-timeout">Configure deployment timeout</h3></a>

By default, when you deploy a machine, MAAS will consider the deployment a failure if it doesn't complete within 30 minutes.  You can configure this timeout, if you wish, with the command:


<pre><code>maas $PROFILE maas set-config name=node-timeout value=$NUMBER_OF_MINUTES
</code></pre>
