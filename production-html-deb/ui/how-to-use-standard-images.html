<p>MAAS is only useful once it has images available to provision its nodes. Therefore, one key post-install task is to select and import images from the boot source. Once MAAS imports images, it will update them on an hourly basis, via a default sync mechanism.  This page explains how to select and import the images that MAAS requires to provision its nodes.</p>
