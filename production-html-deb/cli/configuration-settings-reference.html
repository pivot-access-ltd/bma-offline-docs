</em></strong><strong> Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones (dropdown)

</strong><strong><em> List of external networks (not previously known), that will be allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution (text box)
MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows to add extra networks (not previously known) to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names.
</em></strong><em> NTP
</em><strong><em>* Addresses of NTP servers (text box)
NTP servers, specified as IP addresses or hostnames delimited by commas and/or spaces, to be used as time references for MAAS itself, the machines MAAS deploys, and devices that make use of MAAS&rsquo;s DHCP services.
</em></strong><strong> Use external NTP servers only (check box)
Configure all region controller hosts, rack controller hosts, and subsequently deployed machines to refer directly to the configured external NTP servers. Otherwise only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers, rack contoller hosts will in turn refer to the regions&rsquo; NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks&rsquo; NTP servers.
</strong><strong> Syslog
</strong><strong><em> Remote syslog server to forward machine logs (text box)
A remote syslog server that MAAS will set on enlisting, commissioning, testing, and deploying machines to send all log messages. Clearing this value will restore the default behaviour of forwarding syslog to MAAS.
</em></strong><em> Network discovery
</em><strong><em>* Network discovery (dropdown)
When enabled, MAAS will use passive techniques (such as listening to ARP requests and mDNS advertisements) to observe networks attached to rack controllers. Active subnet mapping will also be available to be enabled on the configured subnets.
</em></strong><strong> Active subnet mapping interval (dropdown)
When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.

Set a configuration value</p>
<p>This method accepts keyword arguments.  Pass each argument as a
key-value pair with an equals sign between the key and the value:
key1=value1 key2=value key3=value3.  Keyword arguments must come after
any positional arguments.</p>
<p>Set a configuration value.</p>
<p>:param value: Optional.  The value of the configuration
item to be set.
:type value: String</p>
<p>:param name: Required.  The name of the
configuration item to be set.</p>
<p>Available configuration items:</p>
<p>:active_discovery_interval: Active subnet mapping interval.         When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.
:boot_images_auto_import: Automatically import/refresh the boot images every 60 minutes.
:boot_images_no_proxy: Set no_proxy with the image repository address when MAAS is behind (or set with) a proxy..         By default, when MAAS is behind (and set with) a proxy, it is used to download images from the image repository. In some situations (e.g. when using a local image repository) it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for MAAS to use the proxy to download images because it can access them directly. Setting this option allows MAAS to access the (local) image repository directly by setting the no_proxy variable for the MAAS env with the address of the image repository.
:commissioning_distro_series: Default Ubuntu release used for commissioning.
:completed_intro: Marks if the initial intro has been completed.
:curtin_verbose: Run the fast-path installer with higher verbosity. This provides more detail in the installation logs.
:default_distro_series: Default OS release used for deployment.
:default_dns_ttl: Default Time-To-Live for the DNS.         If no TTL value is specified at a more specific point this is how long DNS responses are valid, in seconds.
:default_min_hwe_kernel: Default Minimum Kernel Version.         The default minimum kernel version used on all new and commissioned nodes.
:default_osystem: Default operating system used for deployment.
:default_storage_layout: Default storage layout.         Storage layout that is applied to a node when it is commissioned.        Available choices are: &lsquo;bcache&rsquo; (Bcache layout), &lsquo;blank&rsquo; (No storage (blank) layout), &lsquo;custom&rsquo; (Custom layout (from commissioning storage config)), &lsquo;flat&rsquo; (Flat layout), &lsquo;lvm&rsquo; (LVM layout), &lsquo;vmfs6&rsquo; (VMFS6 layout), &lsquo;vmfs7&rsquo; (VMFS7 layout).
:disk_erase_with_quick_erase: Use quick erase by default when erasing disks..         This is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk.
:disk_erase_with_secure_erase: Use secure erase by default when erasing disks.         Will only be used on devices that support secure erase.  Other devices will fall back to full wipe or quick erase depending on the selected options.
:dns_trusted_acl: List of external networks (not previously known), that will be allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution..         MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows to add extra networks (not previously known) to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names.
:dnssec_validation: Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones.         Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of &lsquo;dnssec_validation&rsquo; in the DNS server config.
:enable_analytics: Enable Google Analytics in MAAS UI to shape improvements in user experience.
:enable_disk_erasing_on_release: Erase nodes&rsquo; disks prior to releasing.         Forces users to always erase disks when releasing.
:enable_http_proxy: Enable the use of an APT or YUM and HTTP/HTTPS proxy.         Provision nodes to use the built-in HTTP proxy (or user specified proxy) for APT or YUM. MAAS also uses the proxy for downloading boot images.
:enable_third_party_drivers: Enable the installation of proprietary drivers (i.e. HPVSA).
