### xpub - general purpose translation and publishing tool

**xpub** moves files between local directories, github, and discourse -- and converts discourse markdown to html.  It can deal with a single file, an entire directory, or a range of discourse topics.

Install it in your path and type `xpub help` to get started.

------

**xpub** needs the following libraries:

 - sys
 - subprocess
 - json
 - os
 - time
 - re

Most of these are standard.
