- *Sortable columns*: some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

- *Actions column*: Each table row also has an "Actions" column, which allows you to delete or edit the information in that row.  Note that the delete and/or edit buttons may be greyed out (unavailable) based on your role.

Note that if the table becomes longer than one screen will accomodate, paging buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen.  A search bar is also provided to help you locate a particular user in a longer list.

<a href="#heading--Images"><h2 id="heading--Images">Images</h2></a>

*Settings* > *Images* allows you to specify parameters that control different types of MAAS images.

<a href="#heading--Ubuntu-images"><h3 id="heading--Ubuntu images">Ubuntu images</h3></a>

Under *Settings* > *Images* > *Ubuntu*, you can enable the installation of proprietry drives by selecting the appropriate checkbox.

<a href="#heading--Windows-images"><h3 id="heading--Windows images">Windows images</h3></a>

*Settings* > *Images* > *Windows* allows you to specify the Windows KMS activation host.  This is the FQDN or IP address of the host that provides the KMS Windows activation service, which is needed for Windows deployments that use KMS activation.

<a href="#heading--VMWare-images"><h3 id="heading--VMWare images">VMWare images</h3></a>

If you are using VMWare images, *Settings* > *Images* > *VMware* offers several parameters that you can adjust:

<a href="#heading--License-keys"><h2 id="heading--License-keys">License keys</h2></a>

*Settings* > *License keys* gives you the ability to manage your product licenses in a tabular format:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6935fddce5b33a7952f7bc6eb9c6248b2d2ec733.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6935fddce5b33a7952f7bc6eb9c6248b2d2ec733.png"></a>

- *Add license key button*: This button can be used to add a new license key.

- *Sortable columns*: Note that some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

- *Actions column*: These action buttons allow you to delete or edit the information in that row.  Note that the delete and/or edit buttons may be greyed out (unavailable) based on your role.

Note that if the table becomes longer than one screen will accomodate, paging buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen. A search bar is also provided to help you locate a particular license key in a longer list.

<a href="#heading--Storage"><h2 id="heading--Storage">Storage</h2></a>

Under *Settings* > *Storage*, you can set some parameters related to machine disks:

- *Default storage layout*: The default storage layout that is applied to a machine when it is commissioned.

- *Erase before releasing*: Checking this box forces users to always erase disks when releasing machines.

- *Use secure erase*: Check this box to use secure erase by default when erasing disks. This will only be used on devices that support secure erase. Other devices will fall back to full wipe or quick erase depending on the selected options.

- *Use quick erase*: Check this box to use quick erase by default when erasing disks.  This box is selected separately to provide a fallback for devices that do not support secure erase, should you have selected secure erase as the default method.  Note that this is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk.

<a href="#heading--Network"><h2 id="heading--Network">Network</h2></a>

*Settings* > *Network* allows you to set several network defaults for MAAS machines.

<a href="#heading--HTTP-proxy"><h3 id="heading--HTTP proxy">HTTP proxy</h3></a>

By choosing *Settings* > *Network* > *Proxy*, you can define the HTTP proxy used by MAAS to download images, and used by provisioned machines for APT and YUM packages. Your choices are (1) no proxy, (2) MAAS built-in proxy, (3) external proxy, or (4) peer proxy.  If you choose external or peer proxy, you will be presented with a text box to specify the external proxy URL that the MAAS built-in proxy will use as an upstream cache peer.  Note that machines will be configured to use MAAS' built-in proxy to download APT packages when external or peer proxies are specified.

<a href="#heading--Upstream-DNS"><h3 id="heading--Upstream DNS">Upstream DNS</h3></a>

*Settings* > *Network* > *DNS* lets you set DNS parameters for your MAAS.  Upstream DNS used to resolve domains not managed by this MAAS (space-separated IP addresses).  This only applies when MAAS is running its own DNS server, since this value is used to define forwarding in the DNS server config.  You can set the following parameters:

- *Enable DNSSEC validation*: If you wish to enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones, you can choose the method from this dropdown list.  This is only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'dnssec_validation' in the DNS server config.

- *List of external networks*: You can also provide a ist of external networks to be used for MAAS DNS resolution. MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows you to add extra, previously-unknown networks to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names.

<a href="#heading--NTP-service"><h3 id="heading--NTP service">NTP service</h3></a>

Access the NTP service is controlled using *Settings* > *Network* > *NTP*. You can enter the address of NTP servers, specified as IP addresses or hostnames delimited by commas and/or spaces, to be used as time references for MAAS itself, the machines MAAS deploys, and devices that make use of MAAS's DHCP services.  

You can also instruct MAAS to *Use external NTP only*, so that all daemons and machines refer directly to the external NTP server (and not to each other). If this is not set, only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers; rack contoller hosts will in turn refer to the regions' NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks' NTP servers.

<a href="#heading--Syslog-configuration"><h3 id="heading--Syslog configuration">Syslog configuration</h3></a>

You can use *Settings* > *Network* > *Syslog* to specify a remote syslog server to which machine logs should be forwarded.  MAAS will use this remote syslog server for all log messages when enlisting, commissioning, testing, and deploying machines. Conversely, clearing this value will restore the default behaviour of forwarding syslog entries to MAAS.

<a href="#heading--Network-discovery"><h3 id="heading--Network discovery">Network discovery</h3></a>

*Settings* > *Network* > *Network discovery*, when enabled, will cause MAAS to use passive techniques (such as listening to ARP requests and mDNS advertisements) to observe networks attached to rack controllers. Active subnet mapping will also be available to be enabled on the configured subnets.  You can set the *Active subnet mapping interval* by choosing a desired interval from a dropdown.  When network discovery is enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping, which helps to ensure that discovery information is accurate and complete.

<a href="#heading--Scripts"><h2 id="heading--Scripts">Scripts</h2></a>

Under the section *Settings* > *Scripts*, MAAS provides a great deal of flexibility when dealing with commissioning and testing scripts.

<a href="#heading--Commissioning-scripts"><h3 id="heading--Commissioning-scripts">Commissioning scripts</h3></a>

[tab version="v3.3 Snap,v3.3 Packages" view="CLI"]

<a href="#heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli"><h2 id="heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli">Changing MAAS settings via the MAAS CLI</h2></a>

Assuming you have successfully logged into the MAAS CLI, you can access configuration values using the `maas $PROFILE maas set-config` command.  This command is used to set MAAS configuration values.

This command accepts keyword arguments.  You must pass each argument as a key-value pair, with an equals sign between the key and the value, like this:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE maas set-config key1=value1 key2=value key3=value3 ...
```

These keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments required by a specific command.  The following configuration keywords are currently available:

- *active_discovery_interval*: Active subnet mapping interval. When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.
- *boot_images_auto_import*: Automatically import/refresh the boot images every 60 minutes.
- *boot_images_no_proxy*: Set no_proxy with the image repository address when MAAS is behind (or set with) a proxy. By default, when MAAS is behind (and set with) a proxy, it is used to download images from the image repository. In some situations (e.g. when using a local image repository) it doesn't make sense for MAAS to use the proxy to download images because it can access them directly. Setting this option allows MAAS to access the (local) image repository directly by setting the no_proxy variable for the MAAS env with the address of the image repository.
- *commissioning_distro_series*: Default Ubuntu release used for commissioning.
- *completed_intro*: Marks if the initial intro has been completed.
- *curtin_verbose*: Run the fast-path installer with higher verbosity. This provides more detail in the installation logs.

- *dns_trusted_acl*: List of external networks (not previously known), that will be allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution..         MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows to add extra networks (not previously known) to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names.
- *dnssec_validation*: Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones.         Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'dnssec_validation' in the DNS server config.

- *node_timeout*: Time, in minutes, until the node times out during commissioning, testing, deploying, or entering rescue mode..         Commissioning, testing, deploying, and entering rescue mode all set a timeout when beginning. If MAAS does not hear from the node within the specified number of minutes the node is powered off and set into a failed status.
- *ntp_external_only*: Use external NTP servers only.         Configure all region controller hosts, rack controller hosts, and subsequently deployed machines to refer directly to the configured external NTP servers. Otherwise only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers, rack contoller hosts will in turn refer to the regions' NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks' NTP servers.
- *ntp_servers*: Addresses of NTP servers.         NTP servers, specified as IP addresses or hostnames delimited by commas and/or spaces, to be used as time references for MAAS itself, the machines MAAS deploys, and devices that make use of MAAS's DHCP services.
