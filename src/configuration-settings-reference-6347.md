- *Use quick erase*: Check this box to use quick erase by default when erasing disks.  This box is selected separately to provide a fallback for devices that do not support secure erase, should you have selected secure erase as the default method.  Note that this is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk.

<a href="#heading--Network"><h2 id="heading--Network">Network</h2></a>

You can set some network defaults for MAAS machines.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82f10e6375158387ba01842e2e68b18e638e5966.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82f10e6375158387ba01842e2e68b18e638e5966.png"></a>

<a href="#heading--HTTP-proxy"><h3 id="heading--HTTP proxy">HTTP proxy</h3></a>

Here, you can choose the HTTP proxy used by MAAS to download images, and used by provisioned machines for APT and YUM packages. Your choices are (1) no proxy, (2) MAAS built-in proxy, (3) external proxy, or (4) peer proxy.  If you choose external or peer proxy, you will be presented with a text box to specify the external proxy URL that the MAAS built-in proxy will use as an upstream cache peer. 

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3e3667484f71938d364252566b65eb039251636.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3e3667484f71938d364252566b65eb039251636.png"></a>

<a href="#heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli"><h2 id="heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli">Changing MAAS settings via the MAAS CLI</h2></a>

Assuming you have successfully logged into the MAAS CLI, you can access configuration values using the `maas $PROFILE maas set-config` command.  This command is used to set MAAS configuration values.

This command accepts keyword arguments.  You must pass each argument as a key-value pair, with an equals sign between the key and the value, like this:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE maas set-config key1=value1 key2=value key3=value3 ...
```

These keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments required by a specific command.  The following configuration keywords are currently available:

- *active_discovery_interval*: Active subnet mapping interval. When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.
- *boot_images_auto_import*: Automatically import/refresh the boot images every 60 minutes.
- *boot_images_no_proxy*: Set no_proxy with the image repository address when MAAS is behind (or set with) a proxy. By default, when MAAS is behind (and set with) a proxy, it is used to download images from the image repository. In some situations (e.g. when using a local image repository) it doesn't make sense for MAAS to use the proxy to download images because it can access them directly. Setting this option allows MAAS to access the (local) image repository directly by setting the no_proxy variable for the MAAS env with the address of the image repository.
- *commissioning_distro_series*: Default Ubuntu release used for commissioning.

- *node_timeout*: Time, in minutes, until the node times out during commissioning, testing, deploying, or entering rescue mode..         Commissioning, testing, deploying, and entering rescue mode all set a timeout when beginning. If MAAS does not hear from the node within the specified number of minutes the node is powered off and set into a failed status.
- *ntp_external_only*: Use external NTP servers only.         Configure all region controller hosts, rack controller hosts, and subsequently deployed machines to refer directly to the configured external NTP servers.
