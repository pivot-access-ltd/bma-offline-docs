<!-- "How to label devices" -->
MAAS offers a wide range of device labelling: tags that can carry information; static annotations which can identify and describe machines; and dynamic annotations which can describe current workloads for deployed machines.

- [Tag machines](/t/how-to-tag-machines/5928): The most common tags are machine tags, which can not only help you sort machines, but also help to configure that machine, e.g., with kernel options, when being deployed.

- [Annotate machines](/t/how-to-annotate-machines/5929): You can also annotate machines.  Static annotations stick with a machine as long as it exists.  Dynamic annotations, on the other hand, last only as long as a specific deployment.

- [Use machine tags](/t/how-to-use-machine-tags/5224): There are quite a few nuances to machine tags.

- [Use controller tags](/t/how-to-use-controller-tags/5216): You can also tag controllers to help easily tell them apart.

- [Use storage tags](/t/how-to-use-storage-tags/5232): Storage tags help you mark and remember specialized storage configurations.

- [Use network tags](/t/how-to-use-network-tags/5228): Network tags let you remember how you set up specific network interfaces.
