<!-- "How to label devices" -->
MAAS offers a wide range of device labelling: tags that can carry information; static annotations which can identify and describe machines; and dynamic annotations which can describe current workloads for deployed machines.

## [Tag machines](/t/-/5298)

The most common tags are machine tags, which can not only help you sort machines, but also help to configure that machine, e.g., with kernel options, when being deployed.

## [Annotate machines](/t/-/5929)

You can also annotate machines.  Static annotations stick with a machine as long as it exists.  Dynamic annotations, on the other hand, last only as long as a specific deployment.

## [Use machine tags](/t/-/5224)

There are quite a few nuances to machine tags.

## [Use controller tags](/t/-/5216)

You can also tag controllers to help easily tell them apart.

## [Use storage tags](/t/-/5232)

Storage tags help you mark and remember specialized storage configurations.

## [Use network tags](/t/-/5228)

Network tags let you remember how you set up specific network interfaces.
