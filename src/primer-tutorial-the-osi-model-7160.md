<!-- "Primer tutorial: the OSI model" -->
Let’s explore each of the seven layers of the OSI model through this tutorial.  You’ll get to see how these layers stack together to create the Internet we know today. At the end, we’ll draw you a picture of the OSI “network stack” to help you remember what you’ve learned.

<a href="#heading--Physical-Layer"><h2 id="heading--Physical-Layer">Physical Layer</h2></a>

The Physical Layer deals with the physical aspects of network communication, such as cables and connectors. Use the `ifconfig` command on Ubuntu to display physical network interfaces and their configurations:

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2. Type the following command: 

```nohighlight
ifconfig eth0
# (replace "eth0" with the name of your interface if different)
```

This command provides details about the specified network interface, including its MAC address, speed, and media type. Here's an example output:

```nohighlight
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.100  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 fe80::1234:5678:90ab:cdef  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:11:22:33:44:55  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 123456  bytes 78901234 (78.9 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 234567  bytes 56789012 (56.7 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

In this example, we can observe the following details about the "eth0" interface:

- MAC address: The line ```ether 00:11:22:33:44:55``` displays the MAC (Media Access Control) address, which uniquely identifies the network interface.
- Speed and media type: While not explicitly mentioned in this output, additional information about the speed and media type of the interface may be displayed, depending on the system and network card. This information can include the interface's speed (e.g., 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps) and media type (e.g., Ethernet).

By using the `ifconfig` command and examining the output, we can gain insights into the physical layer attributes of a specific network interface, including its MAC address, speed, and media type. Information at this level is frequently used for troubleshooting network issues, configuring network settings, and understanding the physical characteristics of the network infrastructure.

<a href="#heading--The-Data-Link-Layer"><h2 id="heading--The-Data-Link-Layer">The Data Link Layer</h2></a>

The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI model, responsible for error-free data transfer over a physical link. It handles framing, error detection, and flow control. To see the Data Link Layer in action, use the `arp` command on an Ubuntu system to view the ARP cache:

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2. Type the following command: 

```nohighlight
arp -a
```

Running the `arp -a` command will display the ARP cache entries, which include the IP addresses and corresponding MAC addresses of devices on your local network. Here's an example output:

```nohighlight
router (192.168.0.1) at 00:11:22:33:44:55 [ether] on eth0
laptop (192.168.0.10) at AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF [ether] on eth0
printer (192.168.0.20) at 11:22:33:44:55:66 [ether] on eth0
```

The ARP cache shows the translation of IP addresses to MAC addresses:

- IP address: Each entry represents a device on the network and includes its IP address (e.g., "router" has `192.168.0.1`).
- MAC address: The MAC addresses uniquely identify network interfaces (e.g., "router" has `00:11:22:33:44:55`).

Examining the ARP cache with the `arp` command reveals how the Data Link Layer translates IP addresses to MAC addresses. This translation is crucial for network communication, as MAC addresses are used at this layer to identify devices on the local network, while IP addresses are used at the Network Layer for addressing devices across different networks.

<a href="#heading--The-Network-Layer"><h2 id="heading--The-Network-Layer">The Network Layer</h2></a>

The Network Layer, the third layer of the OSI model, handles logical addressing and routing of data across networks. It determines the best path for data packets from source to destination. To see its functionality, use the `ping` command on an Ubuntu system:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2. Type the following command: 

```nohighlight
ping [destination IP address]
```

The "ping" command sends ICMP echo requests to the destination IP address. It measures round-trip time and verifies connectivity between network devices. Here's some example output:

```nohighlight
Pinging 192.168.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.0.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.0.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.0.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.0.1: bytes=32 time=3ms TTL=64

Ping statistics for 192.168.0.1:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milliseconds:
    Minimum = 1ms, Maximum = 3ms, Average = 1ms
```

Here's what happened:

- Packet routing: When you run the `ping` command, it sends packets containing a request to a specific IP address. The Network Layer determines the best path for these packets to reach the destination by consulting routing tables and protocols like IP.
- Connectivity verification: The `ping` command waits for a reply from the destination device. When it receives the reply, it confirms connectivity and measures the round-trip time. The Network Layer ensures that these packets are properly routed and delivered.

Using `ping`, we can observe how the Network Layer handles packet routing and verifies connectivity between devices. This is important for smooth communication and troubleshooting network issues.

<a href="#heading--The-Transport-Layer"><h2 id="heading--The-Transport-Layer">The Transport Layer</h2></a>

The Transport Layer, the fourth layer of the OSI model, handles connections, reliability, and data transfer for applications. To see how it works, we can use the `netstat` command:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

```nohighlight
netstat -a
```

The `netstat` command displays active network connections and their associated transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP. This allows us to observe how the Transport Layer establishes connections, ensures reliability, and handles data transfer. Here's some example output:

```nohighlight
Active Connections

Proto   Local Address     Foreign Address     State
TCP     0.0.0.0:80        0.0.0.0:0           LISTENING
TCP     192.168.0.10:45678 123.45.67.89:443  ESTABLISHED
UDP     0.0.0.0:53        0.0.0.0:0
```

Using this sample output, we can explore the Transport Layer's functionality in a very direct way:

- Establishing connections: The output shows TCP connections in "LISTENING" and "ESTABLISHED" states. When an application listens on a specific port, like TCP port 80, it waits for incoming connection requests. "LISTENING" means it's ready to accept connections, and "ESTABLISHED" indicates an active connection between local and foreign addresses.

- Maintaining reliability: TCP ensures accurate data delivery without loss. It uses acknowledgement, re-transmission, and flow control to achieve this, guaranteeing successful transmission and reception.

- Handling data transfer: The output includes both TCP and UDP. TCP offers reliable and ordered data transfer, while UDP provides faster but less reliable communication. The Transport Layer segments data, adds protocol-specific headers, and ensures proper delivery to the receiving application.

By using the `netstat` command, we can observe active connections and their transport layer protocols. This helps us understand how the Transport Layer establishes connections, maintains reliability, and handles data transfer between applications.

<a href="#heading--The-Session-Layer"><h2 id="heading--The-Session-Layer">The Session Layer</h2></a>

The Session Layer, the fifth layer of the OSI model, handles the setup, maintenance, and termination of sessions between network applications. It allows for coordinated data exchange between devices or processes. To see how it works, we can use the `telnet` command to create a session between your device and the remote server. We can use that session to demonstrate how the Session Layer manages session establishment, maintenance, and termination.

Here's what to do:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal on your system.
2. Use the `netstat -an` command to display active network connections for any IP address containing “129.129”:

```nohighlight
netstat -an | grep “129.129”
```

3. Type the following command to initiate a Telnet session with the IP address of the “freechess.org” remote server:

```nohighlight
telnet freechess.org
```
   
4. The Session Layer establishes a synchronised session between a Telnet client and “freechess.org”, managing the channel.

5. Don’t interact with the remote server through the Telnet client, so that it will time out in just a minute or two.

6. While the Telnet session is ongoing, use the `netstat -an` command in another command prompt or terminal to display active network connections:
  
```nohighlight
netstat -an | grep “129.129”
```

7. Observe any changes in the network connections, specifically looking for the established Telnet session to the “freechess.org” IP address and port.

8. Wait for the telnet session to time out.  When it does, use that `netstat -an` command again:

```nohighlight
netstat -an | grep “129.129”
```

8. Observe that the Telnet session connection to freechess.org is no longer present in the output.

By using the `telnet` command and monitoring network connections with the `netstat -an` command, we can establish, observe, and terminate a Telnet session, providing a practical demonstration of the functionality of the Session Layer. 

<a href="#heading--The-Presentation-Layer"><h2 id="heading--The-Presentation-Layer">The Presentation Layer</h2></a>

The Presentation Layer, the sixth layer of the OSI model, manages the formatting, encryption, compression, and translation of data to facilitate the exchange of multimedia files and ensure compatibility between different systems.  We’ll demonstrate this by proxy, using translation tools to approximate what goes on at this layer:

1. Assume you have a scenario where a user wants to share a multimedia presentation file (e.g., a LibreOffice Impress presentation) with another user over a network.

2. The user initiates the file transfer process by selecting the multimedia presentation file on their local system.  You might want to put together a simple LibreOffice presentation file with a couple of random slides.  Call it “presentation.odp”.

3. The Presentation Layer first formats the file in a standardised way, ensuring that it can be understood on the receiving end. This formatting can be demonstrated using a command-line tool like "hexdump" to view the hexadecimal representation of the file:

```nohighlight
hexdump -C presentation.odp
```

Your sample output might look something like this:

```nohighlight

```

4. The Presentation Layer then applies any necessary data compression techniques to reduce the file's size, optimising network transmission and storage. This can be demonstrated using a tool like `gzip`:

```nohighlight
gzip presentation.odp
```

5. After this operation, the file’s hex dump looks different:

```nohighlight
$ hexdump -C presentation.odp.gz | less

:
```

6. If encryption is desired for secure transmission, the Presentation Layer can encrypt the file to protect its contents from unauthorised access. You can use a tool like `openssl` to demonstrate encryption:

```nohighlight
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt \
 -in presentation.odp.gz \
 -out presentation.odp.gz.crypt
```

7. Another hex dump will show yet more changes to the file:

```nohighlight
$ hexdump -C presentation.odp.gz.crypt | less

8. Once the file is formatted, compressed, and optionally encrypted, it is ready for transmission over the network. This can be achieved using various network protocols or file transfer utilities, such as "scp" (Secure Copy) or "rsync":

```nohighlight
scp <file> <username>@<remote_server>:<destination_path>
```

9. At the receiving end, the Presentation Layer of the recipient's system receives the transmitted file. The Presentation Layer then performs the reverse processes to the received file.  First, it decrypts the file:

```nohighlight
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d \
-in presentation.odp.gz.crypt \
-out presentation.odp.gz
```

10. Next, it decompresses the data to restore it to its original size and format; for this proxy example, try using `gunzip` to decompress the file:

```nohighlight
gunzip presentation.odp.gz
```

11. Finally, the Presentation Layer presents the multimedia presentation file to the receiving user in a compatible format that can be displayed by the appropriate application or software. You can open the file using the appropriate software, such as LibreOffice:
   
```nohighlight
libreoffice --impress presentation.odp
```

In this example, our faux (proxied) Presentation Layer performs various tasks such as data formatting, compression, encryption, and decryption to ensure the seamless exchange of the multimedia presentation file between users over the network. The provided CLI commands demonstrate each step of the process, albeit by analogy, allowing you to observe the kind of transformations done by the Presentation Layer.

The Presentation Layer's functionalities extend beyond this example, encompassing other tasks such as character encoding conversions, graphic image compression, and handling different data representations between systems. It plays a vital role in enabling interoperability and ensuring that data is properly understood and utilised by different applications and devices within a network.

Here, you got a rough feel for how the various OSI layers manipulate and transfer data, from your application at the Presentation Layer, all the way down to the Physical Layer, and then back to Presentation for display on the other end.  The actual process is more complex and invokes a lot of standards -- which is why it works so reliably.  In the next tutorial, we'll explore these layers in more depth. 

And, as promised, here's a concise picture of what we just covered:
