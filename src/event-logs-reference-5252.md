<!-- "Event logs reference" -->
The events log tracks state changes and the execution of basic configuration steps, serving as a timeline for your MAAS machines.  A simple view of the events log might look something like this:

```
  Time 	                        Event
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:12:35 	Ready
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:12:31 	Running test - smartctl-validate on sda
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:10:37 	Gathering information
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:10:30 	Loading ephemeral
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:10:15 	Performing PXE boot
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:09:54 	Powering on
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:09:53 	Commissioning
```

To view the Events log in the UI -- for a particular machine -- select a machine from the machine list and choose the "Events" tab at the top of the screen. You can also see a more detailed view by selecting "View full history" in near the upper right of the log output.

To view the raw Events log in the CLI, enter the following command:

```
maas $PROFILE events query
```

You can tabulate the results, sorted by machine, with the following command:

```
maas admin events query | jq -r '(["HOSTNAME","TIMESTAMP","TYPE","DESCRIPTION"] | (., map(length*"-"))),
(.events[] | [.hostname, .created, .type, .description // "-"]) | @tsv' | column -t -s $'\t'
```

Non-AUDIT MAAS events can be divided into four categories:

* INFO: informational only; no failure or potential failure state detected.
* WARNING: warnings; a potential failure state was detected, or a failure may occur in the future if this condition is not corrected.
* ERROR: errors; a failure state was observed.  The intended operation likely did not complete successfully.
* DEBUG: debugging messages; internal informational messages, used to help characterize failure states.

These four categories are summarized below.  Both the internal (code) representation and the corresponding external message are shown, as MAAS sometimes throws exceptions which use the internal representation.
