<a href="#heading--how-to-use-the-cli-to-report-audit-events"><h2>How to report audit events</h2></a>

You can display and filter audit events via the CLI.  The basic command to report events is:

```nohighlight
usage: maas $PROFILE events query [--help] [-d] [-k] [data [data ...]]

List node events


This method accepts keyword arguments.  Pass each argument as a
key-value pair with an equals sign between the key and the value:
key1=value1 key2=value key3=value3.  Keyword arguments must come after
any positional arguments.

List node events, optionally filtered by various criteria
via URL query parameters.

:param hostname: Optional.  An optional hostname. Only
events relating to the node with the matching hostname will be
returned. This can be specified multiple times to get events relating
to more than one node.
:type hostname: String

 :param mac_address: Optional.  An optional list of MAC
addresses.  Only nodes with matching MAC addresses will be returned.
:type mac_address: String

 :param id: Optional.  An optional list of system ids.
Only nodes with matching system ids will be returned.
:type id: String

 :param zone: Optional.  An optional name for a physical
zone. Only nodes in the zone will be returned.
:type zone: String

 :param agent_name: Optional.  An optional agent name.
Only nodes with matching agent names will be returned.
:type agent_name: String

 :param level: Optional.  Desired minimum log level of
returned events. Returns this level of events and greater. Choose from:
AUDIT, CRITICAL, DEBUG, ERROR, INFO, WARNING.  The default is INFO.
:type level: String

 :param limit: Optional.  Optional number of events to
return. Default 100.  Maximum: 1000.
:type limit: String

 :param before: Optional.  Optional event id.  Defines
where to start returning older events.
:type before: String

 :param after: Optional.  Optional event id.  Defines
where to start returning newer events.
:type after: String

 :param owner: Optional.  If specified, filters the list
to show only events owned by the specified username.
:type owner: String


Common command-line options:
    --help, -h
	Show this help message and exit.
    -d, --debug
	Display more information about API responses.
    -k, --insecure
	Disable SSL certificate check
```

<a href="#heading--how-to-report-audit-events"><h2 id="heading--how-to-report-audit-events">How to report audit events</h2></a>

To report on audit-level events, you just have to add the `level` parameter to the previous command, like this:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT
```

This produces a stream of JSON representing only the audit events:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "count": 100,
    "events": [
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": "e86c7h",
            "hostname": "valued-moth",
            "id": 12729,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:23",
            "type": "Node",
            "description": "Started deploying 'valued-moth'."
        },
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": "e86c7h",
            "hostname": "valued-moth",
            "id": 12725,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:18",
            "type": "Node",
            "description": "Acquired 'valued-moth'."
        },
       ...
   ],
    "next_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&after=12729",
    "prev_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&before=12383"
}
```

By default, this list is limited to 100 events; that can be changed by specifying the `limit` parameter:

```nohighlight
tormrider@neuromancer:~$ maas admin events query level=AUDIT limit=3
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "count": 3,
    "events": [
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": "e86c7h",
            "hostname": "valued-moth",
            "id": 12729,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:23",
            "type": "Node",
            "description": "Started deploying 'valued-moth'."
        },
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": "e86c7h",
            "hostname": "valued-moth",
            "id": 12725,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:18",
            "type": "Node",
            "description": "Acquired 'valued-moth'."
        },
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": null,
            "hostname": "valued-moth",
            "id": 12502,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:44:51",
            "type": "Node",
            "description": "Aborted 'commissioning' on 'valued-moth'."
        }
    ],
    "next_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&limit=3&after=12729",
    "prev_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&limit=3&before=12502"
}
```

[note]
Non-administrative users will only see their own audit event logs listed.
[/note]

Currently, there is no parameter which will filter on `type_id`.

<a href="#heading--how-to-pretty-print-audit-reports-with-jq"><h2 id="heading--how-to-pretty-print-audit-reports-with-jq">How to pretty-print audit reports with jq</h2></a>

A long stream of JSON is not the most efficient means of reporting audit events.  You can use `jq` to create more concise audit reports.  For example, you can try this command:

```nohighlight
maas admin events query level=AUDIT limit=20 | jq -r '.events[] | [.created, .username, .hostname,.description] | @tsv'
```

This produces a table of the first 20 audit events, filtering out the less interesting fields:

```nohighlight

Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:18	admin	valued-moth	Acquired 'valued-moth'.

Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:30:50	unknown	valued-moth	pci device 31 was removed on node 8wmfx3
```

You can also look for events triggered by a specific user, by adding the `owner` parameter to the CLI invocation above, in this case using the owner `admin`:

```nohighlight
maas admin events query level=AUDIT owner="admin" limit=1000 | jq -r '.events[] | [.created, .username, .hostname,.description] | @tsv'
```

This query returns results similar to these:

```nohighlight
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:23	admin	valued-moth	Started deploying 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:51:18	admin	valued-moth	Acquired 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:44:51	admin	valued-moth	Aborted 'commissioning' on 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:41:52	admin	valued-moth	Started commissioning on 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:41:18	admin	valued-moth	Started releasing 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:40:42	admin	valued-moth	Acquired 'valued-moth'.
Mon, 25 Apr. 2022 21:40:34	admin	valued-moth	Started releasing 'valued-moth'.
Thu, 21 Apr. 2022 19:36:48	admin	valued-moth	Started deploying 'valued-moth'.
Thu, 21 Apr. 2022 19:36:21	admin	valued-moth	Acquired 'valued-moth'.

There are many user-initiated events in MAAS that an administrator or a user may want to audit. These include someone updating the settings or changing a user's permissions. This page details how to query these events and includes examples of how to perform a query, and the type of data logs can provide.

This article will help you learn:

* [How to list audit events for all users](#heading--list-audit-events-for-all-users)
* [How to list audit events for a specific user](#heading--list-audit-events-for-a-specific-user)

<a href="#heading--list-audit-events-for-all-users"><h2 id="heading--list-audit-events-for-all-users">How to list audit events for all users</h2></a>

To list events for all users, use the following syntax:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT
```


The following is example output from the previous command, using admin as the MAAS profile:

``` no-highlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "count": 1,
    "events": [
        {
            "username": "admin",
            "node": null,
            "hostname": "",
            "id": 2569,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Thu, 01 Feb. 2018 22:28:18",
            "type": "Authorisation",
            "description": "User admin logged in."
        }
    ],
    "next_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&after=2569",
    "prev_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&before=2558"
}
```

The above output shows that there is currently only one audit event log for the user `admin`, and that MAAS created this log when they logged into the web UI.

<a href="#heading--list-audit-events-for-a-specific-user"><h2 id="heading--list-audit-events-for-a-specific-user">How to list audit events for a specific user</h2></a>

To list the audit event logs for a specific user that you have permissions for, supply the `owner=$USERNAME` parameter to the query command:

``` bash
maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT owner=$USERNAME
```

As there is only one audit event log in the database (as seen above), generate some more by performing these four actions:

1. Create new non-administrator user `johnnybegood` with `admin` user
2. Logout of web UI as `admin` user and login with `johnnybegood` user
3. Change password of the `johnnybegood` user
4. Log back into the web UI (Django forces a re-login when currently logged in user changes their password).

Let's take a look and see what type of audit event logs we have now, filtering with `owner=johnnybegood` as shown in the following command:

``` bash
maas admin events query level=AUDIT owner=johnnybegood
```

``` bash
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "count": 3,
    "events": [
        {
            "username": "johnnybegood",
            "node": null,
            "hostname": "",
            "id": 2877,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 12 Feb. 2018 22:34:46",
            "type": "Authorisation",
            "description": "User 'johnnybegood' logged in."
        },
        {
            "username": "johnnybegood",
            "node": null,
            "hostname": "",
            "id": 2876,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 12 Feb. 2018 22:34:35",
            "type": "Authorisation",
            "description": "Password changed for 'johnnybegood'."
        },
        {
            "username": "johnnybegood",
            "node": null,
            "hostname": "",
            "id": 2875,
            "level": "AUDIT",
            "created": "Mon, 12 Feb. 2018 22:33:56",
            "type": "Authorisation",
            "description": "User 'johnnybegood' logged in."
        }
    ],
    "next_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&owner=johnnybegood&after=2877",
    "prev_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/events/?op=query&level=AUDIT&owner=johnnybegood&before=2875"
}
```

As we can see above, only audit event logs for the user `johnnybegood` are generated. These events show the following eight items:

1. The user for the event
2. Whether or not the event is associated with a particular node
3. The node's hostname
4. The event id
5. The level of the event
6. when MAAS created the event
7. The event type
8. The event description
