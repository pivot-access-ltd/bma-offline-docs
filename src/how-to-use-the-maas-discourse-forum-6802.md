<!-- How to use the MAAS discourse forum -->
Much of the interaction with the MAAS community takes place via [our Discourse forum](https://discourse.maas.io/).  This article will help you better navigate that forum.

## Discourse categories

Our Discourse forum is divided into a number of public categories:

- The [discourse](https://discourse.maas.io/c/discourse/3) category is a default category provided by the forum tool.  While it sometimes captures posts, it is largely unmonitored and may or may not get you a response within a reasonable timeframe.

- The [docs](https://discourse.maas.io/c/docs/5) category is where our documentation lives.  If you want to edit or comment on documentation, this is the place to do that.

- The [news](https://discourse.maas.io/c/news/7) category is generally confined release announcements and deprecation notices.

- The [users](https://discourse.maas.io/c/users/8) category is where all the action takes place.  This is where you can post (or answer) questions.  This category is monitored by the MAAS developer on duty each week.  We try very hard to minimize the number of posts waiting on answers from us, aiming for that value to be less than 5% of total posts.

- The [integration](https://discourse.maas.io/c/integration/11) category isn't routinely used much any more, so it's advisable to post these questions in "Users" instead.  We may get back to it someday, though.

- The [development](https://discourse.maas.io/c/devel/13) category is intended to be for roadmap and architecture discussions, and is also where we publish our Show and Tell articles.

- The [tutorials](https://discourse.maas.io/c/tutorials/16) category is a place to see various MAAS tutorials.  Some of these tutorials are available elsewhere (e.g., from the [MAAS documentation](https://maas.io/docs).  

- The [deprecations](https://discourse.maas.io/c/deprecations/17) category is strictly for notices and discussions about deprecated features.

- The [performance](https://discourse.maas.io/c/maas-performance/26) category is for notices and discussion about MAAS performance issues.

## User permissions and progression

As a first-time user, you may not immediately have permission to post or comment.  You may continue to review posts until you gain these permissions, or you may message one of the [admins](https://discourse.maas.io/about) by clicking on their picture and then choosing "Message" if you feel you need elevated permissions.

Also please do be sure to review our [FAQ](https://discourse.maas.io/faq) and [Terms of Service](https://ubuntu.com/legal).
