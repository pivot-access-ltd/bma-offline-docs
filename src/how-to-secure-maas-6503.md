<!-- How to secure MAAS -->
Securing your MAAS instance is essential, and fortunately, there are many options to improve its security.

- [Improve MAAS security](/t/how-to-improve-maas-security/5196): To start, you can take simple, everyday steps that go a long way towards securing MAAS. These include [managing user accounts](/t/how-to-manage-user-accounts/5184) and assigning access rights carefully -- among several other measures you can enact.

- [Enable MAAS native TLS](/t/how-to-enable-maas-native-tls/5116): Additionally, MAAS provides a native TLS capability that goes beyond standard TLS. This feature enhances the security of your MAAS instance and helps to protect your data.

- [Use Vault with MAAS](/t/how-to-use-hashicorp-vault-with-maas/6942): If you need extra security, you can use HashiCorp Vault with MAAS to secure your secrets, such as the region-rack secret. With Vault, you can ensure that your sensitive data is safely protected.

- [Set up an air-gapped MAAS](/t/how-to-set-up-an-air-gapped-maas/5212): Another option is to set up an air-gapped MAAS, which allows you to isolate MAAS from the internet using proxies and mirrors. This provides a high level of security and ensures that your data is only accessible to authorized users.

By taking the necessary steps to secure your MAAS instance, you can ensure that your infrastructure is protected, so that your organization can operate with greater confidence. From managing user accounts and enabling native TLS to using HashiCorp Vault and setting up an air-gapped MAAS, there are many options available to you. Consider implementing these security measures -- today -- to keep your MAAS instance safe and secure.
