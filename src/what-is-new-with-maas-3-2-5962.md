<!-- "MAAS 3.2 Beta release notes" -->
We are happy to announce that MAAS 3.2 Beta 3 is now available.  This release provides a new feature -- hardware sync --  and more bug fixes.

<a href="#heading--cumulative-summary"><h3 id="heading--cumulative-summary">Cumulative summary of MAAS 3.2 features and fixes</h3></a>

- [Hardware sync for deployed machines](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-customise-machines#heading--how-to-enable-hardware-sync-on-a-machine): MAAS allows you to sync hardware changes for a deployed and running machine.
 
- [Tag management](/t/how-to-work-with-tags/5928): MAAS now provides greatly expanded tagging capability.
 
- [Support for observability (O11y) in MAAS](/t/how-to-set-up-maas-metrics/5204): MAAS now supports integration with FOSS Observability stacks.

- [Ability for user to specify IPMI cipher suite](/t/power-management-reference/5246): You can explicitly select which cipher suite to use when interacting with a BMC.

- Roll-out of our new tabbed Reader Adaptive Documentation (incremental across the release cycle).

[note]
This is a Beta release, so you may encounter bugs and incomplete features.  We strongly recommend that you take the necessary precautions, which include (but are not limited to) the following steps:

- Install Beta versions on a system specifically designated for testing; Beta is not recommended for production.
- Take a backup of any unrecoverable data on your test system prior to installing Beta versions.
- More specifically, if you use a system for testing MAAS releases, back up the MAAS database and any unique configuration files related to your use of MAAS prior to installing Beta versions.

Also, you should make sure that you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.  [Here's how you can upgrade that](https://discourse.maas.io/t/upgrading-postgresql-to-version-12/5913).

Essentially, expect that the Beta may not function properly under all conditions, possibly overwriting data and configuration information on the test machine.  Beta versions usually behave fairly well, but be warned that across-the-board, error-free performance isn't something we expect from Beta releases.
 
As you encounter failures, please take the time to [file a bug](https://maas.io/docs/report-a-bug) or let us know your thoughts [on the discourse user forum](https://discourse.maas.io/c/users/8).
