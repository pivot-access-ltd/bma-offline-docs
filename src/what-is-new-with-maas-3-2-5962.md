<!-- "MAAS 3.2 Beta release notes" -->
We are happy to announce that MAAS 3.2 Beta 4 is now available.

<a href="#heading--new-features"><h2 id="heading--new-features">New MAAS 3.2 features</h2></a>

MAAS 3.2 provides several new features, as well as the usual cadre of bug fixes.

<a href="#heading--maas-native-tls"><h3 id="heading--maas-native-tls">MAAS native TLS</h3></a>

MAAS 3.2 provides [native TLS](/t/how-to-enable-tls-encryption/5116#heading--about-maas-native-tls). MAAS now has built-in TLS support for communicating with the UI and API over HTTPS. This eliminates the need to deploy a separate TLS-terminating reverse-proxy solution in front of MAAS to provide secure access to API and UI.  Note that you can still set up an HA proxy if you are using multiple controllers.

<a href="#heading--hardware-sync-for-deployed-machines"><h3 id="heading--hardware-sync-for-deployed-machines">Hardware sync for deployed machines</h3></a>

MAAS 3.2 allows you to [sync hardware changes for deployed machines](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-customise-machines#heading--how-to-enable-hardware-sync-on-a-machine).  You can see real-time updates to storage, etc., for a running machine.  This feature requires a special parameter be set prior to deployment.  Coupled with the existing ability to commission deployed machines, MAAS 3.2 moves a step closer to real-time reconfiguration of active, deployed, bare-metal.

<a href="#heading--expanded-tagging-capability"><h3 id="heading--expanded-tagging-capability">Expanded tagging capability</h3></a>
 
MAAS 3.2 provides greatly [expanded tagging capability](/t/how-to-work-with-tags/5928#heading--automatic-tags).  You can auto-apply tags to machines that match a custom XPath expression. Setting up an automatic tag lets you recognise special hardware characteristics and settings, e.g., the gpu passthrough.

<a href="#heading--more-new-features"><h3 id="heading--more-new-features">More new features</h3></a>

MAAS 3.2 rounds out the feature set with a few more items:

- [Support for observability (O11y) in MAAS](/t/how-to-set-up-maas-metrics/5204): MAAS now supports integration with FOSS Observability stacks.

- [Ability for user to specify IPMI cipher suite](/t/power-management-reference/5246): You can explicitly select which cipher suite to use when interacting with a BMC.

- Roll-out of our new tabbed Reader Adaptive Documentation (incremental across the release cycle): We've eliminated the top menus; each page now contains information for all versions, selectable by dropdowns above the relevant sections.

[note]
This is a Beta release, so you may encounter bugs and incomplete features.  We strongly recommend that you take the necessary precautions, which include (but are not limited to) the following steps:

- Install Beta versions on a system specifically designated for testing; Beta is not recommended for production.
- Take a backup of any unrecoverable data on your test system prior to installing Beta versions.
- More specifically, if you use a system for testing MAAS releases, back up the MAAS database and any unique configuration files related to your use of MAAS prior to installing Beta versions.

Also, you should make sure that you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.  [Here's how you can upgrade that](https://discourse.maas.io/t/upgrading-postgresql-to-version-12/5913).

Essentially, expect that the Beta may not function properly under all conditions, possibly overwriting data and configuration information on the test machine.  Beta versions usually behave fairly well, but be warned that across-the-board, error-free performance isn't something we expect from Beta releases.
 
As you encounter failures, please take the time to [file a bug](https://maas.io/docs/report-a-bug) or let us know your thoughts [on the discourse user forum](https://discourse.maas.io/c/users/8).
