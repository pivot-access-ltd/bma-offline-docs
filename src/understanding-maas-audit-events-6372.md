<!-- "Understanding MAAS audit events" -->

An audit event is a [MAAS event](/t/understanding-maas-events/6373) tagged with `AUDIT`. It captures changes to the MAAS configuration and machine states. These events provide valuable oversight of user actions and automated updates -- and their effects -- especially when multiple users are interacting with multiple machines.  See [Understanding MAAS events](/t/understanding-maas-events/6373) for basic usage of the CLI `events query` command.

<a href="#heading--Viewing-events"><h2 id="heading--Viewing-events">Viewing events</h2></a>

Audit events are examined using the MAAS CLI with the `level=AUDIT` parameter set:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT
```

You can use `jq` to prettify the output:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT after=0 limit=20 \
| jq -r '(["USERNAME","HOSTNAME","DATE","EVENT"] | 
(., map(length*"-"))),
(.events[] | [.username,.hostname,.created,.description]) 
| @tsv' | column -t -s$'\t'
```

This command might produce output similar to this:

```nohighlight
USERNAME  HOSTNAME     DATE                        EVENT

You can also use the [various event filters](/t/understanding-maas-events/6373#heading--filter-parameters) with `level=AUDIT` to further restrict your output.

<a href="#heading--The-meaning-of-audit-events"><h3 id="heading--The-meaning-of-audit-events">The meaning of audit events</h3></a>

Let's walk through a sample of, say, eighteen audit events and see how to interpret and use them.  

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT limit=18 after=0 | jq -r '(["USERNAME","NODE","HOSTNAME","LEVEL","DATE","TYPE","EVENT"] | 
(., map(length*"-"))),
(.events[] | [.username,.node,.hostname,.level,.created,.type,.description]) 
| @tsv' | column -t -s$'\t'
```

Consider the resulting `jq` output:

```nohighlight
USERNAME     NODE    HOSTNAME       LEVEL  DATE                        TYPE  EVENT

All of these example events are type `Node`, referring to a machine actions.  Node events are probably the most important audit events, because they capture machine life-cycle changes.  When auditing your MAAS, life-cycle events are often the most useful.

Take a moment to consider the MAAS life-cycle, which can be depicted with this state table:

| Machine state | Cm | Aq | Dp | Rl | Ab | Cl | PC | Ts | Rsq | Bk | Lk | Fx | Tg | RP | SZ | Del |
|---------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| New           | Y  |    |    |    |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y   |    |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Failed        | Y  |    |    |    |    |    |    | Y  | Y   | Y  |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Commissioning |    |    |    |    | Y  |    |    |    |     | Y  |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  |     |
| Ready         | Y  | Y  | Y  |    |    | Y  |    | Y  | Y   | Y  |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Acquired      | Y  |    | Y  | Y  |    |    |    | Y  | Y   | Y  |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Deploying     |    |    |    | Y  | Y  |    | Y  |    |     |    | Y  |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Deployed      |    |    |    | Y  |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y   | Y  | Y  |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Broken        | Y  |    |    |    |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y   |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |
| Rescue mode   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | X   |    |    |    | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   |

The key for the table columns is as follows:

- *Cm* - can commission.
- *Aq* - can acquire.
- *Dp* - can deploy.
- *Rl* - can release.
- *Ab* - can abort an operation in progress.
- *Cl* - can clone the machine.
- *PC* - can power-cycle the machine (turn in on or off).
- *Ts* - can run tests on the machine.
- *Rsq* - can put the machine in Rescue Mode.
- *Bk* - can mark the machine as broken.
- *Lk* - can lock the machine, preventing others from accessing it.
- *Fx* - can move a broken machine to a fixed state.
- *Tg* - can set tags for a machine.
- *RP* - can set the resource pool for a machine.
- *SZ* - can set the zone for a machine.
- *Del* - can delete the machine.

3944    AUDIT  Node           clark     Deleted the 'machine' 'sweet-urchin'.
```

This is a long (but varied) listing, so there are many questions you might be able to answer:

1. Who deployed `comic-muskox`? 

2. What happened to `sweet-urchin`?

3. Why is `fleet-calf` in rescue mode?

4. Where did these changes come from in `setup.sh`?

5. What caused `ruling-bobcat` to be marked as broken?

6. Who's responsible for the DHCP snippet called `foo`?

Audit events don't answer all questions, but they help you discover whom to ask.

<a href="#heading--Auditing-with-finesse"><h3 id="heading--Auditing-with-finesse">Auditing with finesse</h3></a>

You can use the MAAS CLI, `jq`, and command line text tools to finesse your auditing.  First, you'll have to get a feel for how MAAS describes audit events:

- Set the resource pool to 
- Started commissioning 
- Aborted 'commissioning'
- Started releasing 
- Created DHCP snippet
- Saved script 
- Updated configuration setting 
- Deleted the 'machine' 
- Created user

You can use these snippets as search keys.  Say you walk into the data centre one day and a couple of machines just aren't there any more.  You could run this command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query limit=1000 after=0 level=AUDIT \
hostname=new-bedbug hostname=sweet-urchin \
| jq -r '(.events[] | [.id,.level,.type,.username,.description]) 
| @tsv' | column -t -s$'\t' \
| grep "Deleted the"
```

Within 30 seconds, you'd know whom to ask:

```nohighlight
7615    AUDIT  Node  barry     Deleted the 'machine' 'new-bedbug'.
3944    AUDIT  Node  clark     Deleted the 'machine' 'sweet-urchin'.
```
Or, you could just check to see what's been deleted:

Of course, that's a complex list, so could simplify, sort, remove any duplicates, and prettify the list a bit with already-available tools:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query limit=1000 after=0 level=AUDIT \
| jq -r '(.events[] | [.description]) | @tsv' \
| column -t -s$'\t' \
| grep "Deleted the" \
| cut -f 4 -d" " \
| sort -u | sed -e"s/'//g" | sed -e"s/\.//g"
```

This would give you a list of machines that have been deleted at least once:

Still a bit long, but using your imagination and additional command line utilities, you could pare this down even more.

The important points for working with audit data are:

- there are filters available to pinpoint several event attributes, limit the number of records, and focus on a specific set of records.
- the native output of `events query` is JSON; if you have good JSON tools handy, you can use those tools to parse the data further.
- if you don't have JSON tools handy, you can always use `jq` to produce workable text output, which you can then manipulate using standard CLI text tools.

There's probably no limit to what you can figure out if you use audit events properly.
