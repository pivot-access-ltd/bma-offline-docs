<!-- "Understanding MAAS audit events" -->

Audit events must be examined using the MAAS CLI, as there is no corresponding MAAS web UI tool at present.

The CLI command `events query level=AUDIT` will help you review audit events:

```nohighlight
$ maas admin events query level=AUDIT
```

This command will show you 100 successive audit events, with no filtering, in JSON format.  Since JSON format can be very long, we recommend that you apply the `jq` tool to present records in a more readable way.  For example, the following command picks out the first 20 audit events currently available on your MAAS host:

```nohighlight
$ maas admin events query level=AUDIT after=0 limit=20 \
| jq -r '(["USERNAME","HOSTNAME","DATE","EVENT"] | 
(., map(length*"-"))),
(.events[] | [.username,.hostname,.created,.description]) 
| @tsv' | column -t -s$'\t'
```

This command might produce output simlar to this:

```nohighlight
USERNAME  HOSTNAME     DATE                        EVENT
--------  --------     ----                        -----
