<!-- deb-2-7-cli
MAAS doesn't support TLS encryption natively.  If you are not interested in [setting up an HAProxy](/t/high-availability/2688#heading--load-balancing-with-haproxy-optional), you can enable TLS independently in the web server software (e.g. Apache, Nginx) which users access directly.  The examples below explain how to create this configuration.
