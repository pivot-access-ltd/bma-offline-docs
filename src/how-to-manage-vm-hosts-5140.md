<!-- How to manage vm hosts -->
In order to  deploy a VM host in your MAAS network, you first need to set up a bridge to connect between your VM host and MAAS itself. Once that's done, you can add and manage VM hosts -- and subsequently, create VMs to act as MAAS machines.  This article explains:

To enable VM host networking features, MAAS must match the VM host IP address of a potential VM host with a known device (a machine or controller). For example, if a machine not known to MAAS is set up as a VM host, enhanced interface selection features will not be available.

[note]
It's essential to enforce usage of IP addresses to avoid domain name conflicts, should different controllers resolve the same domain name with different IP addresses. You should also avoid using 127.0.0.1 when running multiple controllers, as it would confuse MAAS.

To set up a VM host bridge with the Web UI:

1. Select *Machines*.

2. Select the machine you want to use as a VM host.

3. Select *Network*.

4. Select the network where you want to create the bridge.

5. Select *Create bridge*.

6. Configure the bridge on a subnet MAAS controls.  You may use any IP mode for the bridge.

7. Register your changes with *Create bridge*.

Then you can deploy Ubuntu.

<a href="#heading--maas-bridge-cli"><h2 id="heading--maas-bridge-cli">How to use the MAAS API to configure a bridge</h2></a>

You can also use the MAAS CLI/API to configure a VM host bridge, with the following procedure:

1. Select the interface you wish to configure the bridge on. This example uses the boot interface, since the boot interface must be connected to a MAAS controlled network -- but any interface is allowed:

        INTERFACE_ID=$(maas $PROFILE machine read $SYSTEM_ID | jq .boot_interface.id)

2. Create the bridge:

         BRIDGE_ID=$(maas $PROFILE interfaces create-bridge $SYSTEM_ID name=br0 parent=$INTERFACE_ID | jq .id)

3. Select the subnet where you want the bridge (this should be a MAAS controlled subnet):

        SUBNET_ID=$(maas $PROFILE subnets read | jq -r '.[] | select(.cidr == "10.0.0.0/24" and .managed == true).id')

4. Connect the bridge to the subnet:

          maas $PROFILE interface link-subnet $SYSTEM_ID $BRIDGE_ID subnet=$SUBNET_ID mode="STATIC" ip_address="10.0.0.101"

<a href="#heading--maas-bridge-netplan"><h2 id="heading--maas-bridge-netplan">How to set up a VM host bridge with netplan</h2></a>

You can also use netplan to configure a VM host bridge:

Open your netplan configuration file.  This should be in `/etc/netplan`.  It could be called `50-cloud-init.yaml`, `netplan.yaml`, or something else.  Modify the file to add a bridge, using the example below to guide you:

```nohighlight
network:
    bridges:
        br0:
            addresses:
            - 10.0.0.101/24

            mtu: 1500

```

Apply the new configuration with `netplan apply`.

<a href="#heading--maas-bridge-libvirt"><h2 id="heading--maas-bridge-libvirt">How to set up a VM host bridge with libvirt</h2></a>

It is also possible to use [libvirt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt)`↗` to configure a virtual bridge.  This method will also work for LXD VM hosts running on Ubuntu.  Be aware that other methods may be required if you are configuring LXD on an OS other than Ubuntu.

By default, libvirt creates a virtual bridge, `virbr0`, through which VMs communicate with each other and the Internet. DHCP, supplied by libvirt, automatically assigns an IP address to each VM.  However, to enable network booting in MAAS, you’ll need to provide DHCP in MAAS and either:

- Disable DHCP on libvirt’s `default` network, or
- Create a new libvirt network `maas` with DHCP disabled.

You can set up such a `maas` network like this:

```nohighlight
cat << EOF > maas.xml
<network>
 <name>maas</name>
 <forward mode='nat'>
   <nat>
     <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
   </nat>
 </forward>
 <dns enable="no" />
 <bridge name='virbr1' stp='off' delay='0'/>
 <domain name='testnet'/>
 <ip address='172.16.99.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
 </ip>
</network>
EOF
virsh net-define maas.xml
```

Note that this network also has NAT port forwarding enabled to allow VMs to communicate with the Internet at large. Port forwarding is very useful in test environments.

<a href="#heading--set-up-ssh"><h2 id="heading--set-up-ssh">How to set up SSH for use by libvirt</h2></a>

For MAAS to successfully communicate with libvirt on your VM host machine -- whether you're running from snap or package, or running rack controllers in LXD containers or on localhost -- this example command must succeed from every rack controller:

```nohighlight
virsh -c qemu+ssh://$USER@$VM_HOST_IP/system list --all
```

Here, `$USER` is a user on your VM host who is a member of the `libvirtd` Unix group on the VM host, and `$VM_HOST_IP` is the IP of your VM host.  **Note** that insufficient permissions for `$USER` may cause the `virsh` command to fail with an error such as `failed to connect to the hypervisor`. Check the `$USER` group membership to make sure `$USER` is a member of the `libvirtd` group.

Using the CLI, it's possible to update the configuration of a VM host.  You can change these configurable parameters with an `update` command -- but first, you'll want to know how to check the values of configurable parameters, both before and after the change.

<a href="#heading--list-vm-hosts"><h3 id="heading--list-vm-hosts">How to list VM-hosts</h3></a>

To begin, you can list your available KVM-hosts with the following command:

```nohighlight
maas admin vm-hosts read | jq -r '(["ID, "VM-HOST","SYSID","CORES",
"USED","RAM", "USED","STORAGE", "USED"] | (., map(length*"-"))),
(.[]| [.id,.name,.host.system_id,.total.cores, .used.cores, .total.memory, .used.memory,.total.local_storage, .used.local_storage])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

<a href="#heading--list-config-params"><h3 id="heading--list-config-params">How to list configurable VM host parameters</h3></a>

There are just a few parameters that you can change for a VM host.  You can list these, on a per-host basis, using the following two-step procedure:

1. Run the command above to get the VM host ID (different from the System ID, see the first column in the listing).

2. Enter the following command to list configurable parameters:

```nohighlight
maas admin vm-host read $ID | jq -r '(["ID","NAME","POOL","ZONE",
"CPU-O/C", "RAM-O/C", "TAGS"] | (., map(length*"-"))), (.| [.id,.name,
.pool.name, .zone.name,.cpu_over_commit_ratio, 
.memory_over_commit_ratio, .tags[]]) | @tsv' | column -t
```

where $ID is the ID (not System ID) of the VM-host.

<a href="#heading--change-vm-host-name"><h3 id="heading--change-vm-host-name">How to change a VM host's name</h3></a>

You can change the VM host's name very simply, with this command:

    maas admin vm-host update $ID name=$NEW_NAME

where $ID is the VM host's ID (not System ID), and $NEW_NAME is the new name you want to assign.  You can check that the change was successful by just printing out the ID and name, like this:

```nohighlight
maas admin vm-host read $ID | jq -r '(["ID","NAME"] 
| (., map(length*"-"))), (.| [.id,.name]) 
| @tsv' | column -t
```

<a href="#heading--change-vm-host-pool"><h3 id="heading--change-vm-host-pool">How to change a VM host's pool</h3></a>

You can also change the VM host's pool with a simple command:

```nohighlight
maas admin vm-host update $ID pool=$VALID_POOL
```

where $ID is the VM host's ID (not System ID), and $VALID_POOL is the name of a pool that already exists.  If you mention a pool you haven't created yet, you'll get an error like this:

```nohighlight
{"pool": ["Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices."]}
```

```nohighlight
maas admin resource-pools read | jq -r '.[] | (.name)'
```

If you really want to set your VM host to a new one, you just need to create a new one with this command:

```nohighlight
maas admin resource-pools create name=$NEW_POOL_NAME
```

Then double-check it with `catvmpools`, and assign your VM host to it using the earlier command. 

<a href="#heading--list-resources-of-all-vm-hosts"><h2 id="heading--list-resources-of-all-vm-hosts">How to list the resources of all VM hosts</h2></a>

```nohighlight

Update overcommit ratios for a KVM host:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE vm-host update $VM_HOST_ID power_address=qemu+ssh://ubuntu@192.168.1.2/system \
        power_pass=example cpu_over_commit_ratio=2.5 memory_over_commit_ratio=10.0
```

Update the default storage pool used by a KVM host:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE vm-host update $VM_HOST_ID power_address=qemu+ssh://ubuntu@192.168.1.2/system \
        power_pass=example default_storage_pool=pool2
```

MAAS takes advantage of the existing LXD clustering capability.

<a href="#heading--about-lxd-clusters"><h4 id="heading--about-lxd-clusters">About LXD clusters</h4></a>

LXD clusters within the context of MAAS are a way of viewing and managing existing VM host clusters and composing VMs within said cluster.  MAAS will not create a new cluster, but will discover an existing cluster when you provide the info for adding a single clustered host.

<a href="#heading--how-to-add-lxd-clusters"><h4 id="heading--how-to-add-lxd-clusters">How to add LXD clusters</h4></a>

MAAS assumes you have already configured a cluster within the context of LXD. You then need to configure this cluster with a single trust MAAS will use to communicate with said cluster. 

The process of adding a LXD cluster is [identical to the procedure for adding a LXD VM host](#heading--adding-a-vm-host).  The only difference is that the name you provide will be used for the cluster instead of the individual host. 

MAAS will then connect to the provided host and discover the other hosts within the cluster, and rename the initially defined host with the cluster member name configured in LXD. The VM host will show up as a *Cluster* on the dashboard. 

<a href="#heading--how-to-compose-vms-in-lxd-clusters"><h4 id="heading--how-to-compose-vms-in-lxd-clusters">How to compose VMs in LXD clusters</h4></a>

To compose VMs in a LXD cluster, follow the procedure for [adding a VM to a VM host](/t/how-to-create-and-manage-vms/5148). 

<a href="#heading--how-to-delete-lxd-clusters"><h3 id="heading--how-to-delete-lxd-clusters">How to delete LXD clusters</h3></a>

To delete a LXD cluster, [delete any VM host within the cluster](#heading--deleting-a-vm-host).  

[note]
This will delete the cluster and **all** members within the cluster.  Make sure that's what you want to do.
