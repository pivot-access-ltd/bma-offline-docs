Some of these may not make complete sense until you've read [about machines](/t/machines/4030).

<a href="#heading--machine-list"><h2 id="heading--machine-list">View the machine list</h2></a>

You can view the list of machines from the choice "Machines" on the top menu of the MAAS web UI.  This action will display a table like the one above, listing all the machines that are currently visible to your MAAS installation.  During commissioning and deployment, MAAS updates the table to reflect the changing state of each machine. These values are augmented with green, amber and red icons to represent successful, in-progress and failed transitions, respectively. The MAAS web UI employs similar icons and colours throughout the interface to reflect a machine's status. 

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/19e038dbc6e669bfffc0ea5a9946432a75142bfb.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/19e038dbc6e669bfffc0ea5a9946432a75142bfb.jpeg"></a> 

Rolling the cursor over status icons often reveals more details. For example, a failed hardware test script will place a warning icon alongside the hardware type tested by the script. Rolling the cursor over this will reveal which test failed.  Likewise, you can find some immediate options by rolling over the column data items in the machines table.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/8f78a8877a029e7a44bcd4cf3d138499637fe790.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/8f78a8877a029e7a44bcd4cf3d138499637fe790.jpeg"></a> 

The 'Add hardware' drop-down menu is used to add either new machines or a new chassis. This menu changes context when one or more machines are selected from the table, using either the individual checkboxes in the first column or the column title checkbox to select all.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/9a0747649e6aff999d3c04335eb752accedaf3de.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/9a0747649e6aff999d3c04335eb752accedaf3de.jpeg"></a> 

With one or more machines selected, the 'Add hardware' drop-down menu moves to the left, and is joined by the 'Take action' menu.  This menu provides access to the various [machine actions](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#node-actions) that can be applied to the selected machine(s):

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/e03d5ac8de9ea4f4827ed057bb2dd83e241aac3b.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/e03d5ac8de9ea4f4827ed057bb2dd83e241aac3b.jpeg"></a> 

[note]
The 'Filter by' section limits the machines listed in the table to selected keywords and machine attributes.
[/note]

<a href="#heading--node-details"><h2 id="heading--node-details">View machine details</h2></a>

Click a machine's FQDN or MAC address to open a detailed view of a machine's status and configuration.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8ff4caf6362a3d695682499a74d64cb189dfc37.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8ff4caf6362a3d695682499a74d64cb189dfc37.png"></a>

The default view is 'Machine summary', presented as a series of cards detailing the CPU, memory, storage and tag characteristics of the machine, as well as an overview of its current status. When relevant, 'Edit' links take you directly to the settings pane for the configuration referenced within the card.  The machine menu bar within the web UI also includes links to logs, events, and configuration options:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21e9f4dca3a3e0a6657b5b2a570c9fc68a3e4961.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21e9f4dca3a3e0a6657b5b2a570c9fc68a3e4961.png"></a> 

The menu includes links to a number of additional forms and controls, as described in the following sections.

rad-begin /snap/3.0/ui /deb/3.0/ui /snap/3.0/cli /deb/3.0/cli
<a href="#heading--usb-pci-devices"><h2 id="heading--usb-pci-devices">How to manage attached USB and PCI devices</h2></a>

The machines in your MAAS may have devices attached to them via USB or PCI interface, such as keyboards, cameras, network cards, GPUs, etc.  MAAS will recognize these devices and make them visible to you when a machine is commissioned.



For example, the machine details presents USB and PCI devices like this:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/87f42bafe321d45af94d73216f933a9067f01df2.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/87f42bafe321d45af94d73216f933a9067f01df2.png"></a>

Note that this page now includes two new tabs: "PCI devices" and "USB."  For each USB/PCI device attached to your machine, these tabs will list:

- device type
- vendor ID
- a product description
- a product ID
- the driver name
- the containing NUMA node (if any)
- the device address

A typical PCI device tab would look something like this:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82e1e6f8bc511047ac5f773430f7e5812c7a24d4.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82e1e6f8bc511047ac5f773430f7e5812c7a24d4.png"></a>

The USB tab presents similar information in the same format.

[note]
If you are upgrading from a previous version of MAAS, PCI and USB devices aren't modeled, so you will have to recommission the machine to capture these devices.
[/note]


Once you've commissioned the machine, you have the option of deleting PCI/USB devices from the machine in any machine state, via the CLI only, using the following command:

```
maas $PROFILE node-device delete $SYSTEM_ID $DEVICE_ID
```

where:

- $PROFILE   = your user profile (e.g., "admin")
- $SYSTEM_ID = the ID of the machine in question (e.g., "ngx7ry")
- $DEVICE_ID = the ID of the device you want to delete 

If the device is still present in the system, it will be recogized again (and thus "recreated")
when the machine is commissioned again.


<a href="#heading--machine-interfaces"><h2 id="heading--machine-interfaces">How to find network info for a machine</h2></a>


The Network "tab" provides you with a way to view/edit the network and interface configuration for a machine: 

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5316db130ae05a9cdabcd49ffaa69f0bb405d1d.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5316db130ae05a9cdabcd49ffaa69f0bb405d1d.png"></a> 

In the case of this deployed machine, there are not many editing options.  If the machine is in a 'Ready' state, though, altering the network configuration is possible, as shown in the screenshot above.


Options on this tab are described in the introduction to [Networking](/t/networking/4046) article in this documentation set.

<a href="#heading--machine-storage"><h2 id="heading--machine-storage">How to find storage info for a machine</h2></a>

The Storage tab on the machine list brings up a form that allows you to view/edit the file system, partitioning and storage parameters for the selected machine:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/6/658f4814716a1347fda62ab799ba0d72506c128e.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/6/658f4814716a1347fda62ab799ba0d72506c128e.png"></a> 

This tab describes the filesystem(s) in use, as well as the available and used partitions for this machine.  See the article [Storage](/t/storage/4106) for a detailed discussion on how to use this screen, as well as many other considerations for machine storage configurations.

<a href="#heading--commissioning-log"><h2 id="heading--commissioning-log">How to find commissioning logs</h2></a>

The "Commissioning" tab brings up a summary log of commissioning events:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e98766009f32972dfe29293f9bc850b99a9a941f.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e98766009f32972dfe29293f9bc850b99a9a941f.png"></a> 

Click on the dropdown at the end of the row you're interested in, and click on "View details":

This will bring up a detailed log view for that row:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41a385cdf948dada8bb8d8f94a3137a2b64d46e0.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41a385cdf948dada8bb8d8f94a3137a2b64d46e0.png"></a>

These logs present an extremely detailed, timestamped record of completion and status items from the commissioning process.  

<a href="#heading--hardware-tests"><h2 id="heading--hardware-tests">How to find machine hardware & test logs</h2></a>

This tab presents a summary of tests run against this particular machine:  

<a href="See the article on [Logging](/t/maas-logging/4010) for more details on how to read and interpret these logs." target = "_blank"><img src="See the article on [Logging](/t/maas-logging/4010) for more details on how to read and interpret these logs."></a> 

You can view the summary report, or choose the "View details" dropdown to get details on any particular tests:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e53a2c01b57df49e56bb4d95552b6a038249aa97.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e53a2c01b57df49e56bb4d95552b6a038249aa97.png"></a> 

The format of these screens is very similar to the Configuration logs shown above.  For more information, please see the article on [Hardware testing](/t/hardware-testing/3942).

<a href="#heading--raw-log-output"><h2 id="heading--raw-log-output">How to find raw log output for a machine</h2></a>

By choosing "Installation output" on the "Logs" tab, you can see the "raw" log output:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dc5bb5e6489a382e257dac605f2dbdc6fa1ca630.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dc5bb5e6489a382e257dac605f2dbdc6fa1ca630.png"></a> 

Help interpreting these logs can be found under the [Logging](/t/maas-logging/4010) section of this documentation.

<a href="#heading--event-logs"><h2 id="heading--event-logs">How to find a machine's event logs</h2></a>

To view the Event log for a machine, choose the "Event" tab under "Logs."  This displays a list of timestamped status updates for events and actions performed on the machine:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/981a1aced2a4c231fa9e4fe1b70e77aeb816f133.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/981a1aced2a4c231fa9e4fe1b70e77aeb816f133.png"></a> 

There is a dropdown on the upper right which allows you to choose how many events per page you wish to view. Detailed discussion of this event log can be found under the [Logging](/t/maas-logging/4010) section of this documentation.

<a href="#heading--machine-config"><h2 id="heading--machine-config">How to find machine configuration info</h2></a>

The final tab from the Machine menu allows you to update machine and power configuration options: 

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7cfd77228a5cf1a6f779897d501f14fbf78fd4b4.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7cfd77228a5cf1a6f779897d501f14fbf78fd4b4.png"></a> 

There are two sections to this tab.  The "Machine configuration" section, shown above, offers some general parameters, mostly related to how this machine is grouped and categorised.  More information on these options are found in the relevant sections of the documentation (e.g., tags, resource pools, and so forth). 

The "Power configuration" supplies the parameters necessary for MAAS to access the machine to PXE-boot it: 

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/198898362285e4a1308535a4aa701156a67c9616.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/198898362285e4a1308535a4aa701156a67c9616.png"></a> 

More information on Power configuration will be found in the [Power management](/t/power-management/4070) section of this documentation.
