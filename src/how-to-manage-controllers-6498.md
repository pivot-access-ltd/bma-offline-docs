<!-- "How to manage controllers" -->
Controllers are the backbone of MAAS.

## [Adjust your controllers](/t/how-to-adjust-your-controllers/5172)

MAAS initializes with one rack and one region controller.  Your local environment, though, may require more controllers -- or even specialised controller configurations.

### [High availability](/t/-how-to-enable-high-availability/5120)

Just by adding rack and region controllers, you create high-availability, but there are some specific choices you can make that help to tailor your HA environment.
