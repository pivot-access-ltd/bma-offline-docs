<!-- "How to manage controllers" -->
Controllers are the backbone of MAAS.

- [Configure controllers](/t/how-to-configure-controllers/5172): MAAS initializes with one rack and one region controller.  Your local environment, though, may require more controllers -- or even specialised controller configurations.

- [Enable high availability](/t/how-to-enable-high-availability/5120): Just by adding rack and region controllers, you create high-availability, but there are some specific choices you can make that help to tailor your HA environment.
