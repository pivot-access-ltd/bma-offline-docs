<!-- "How to manage controllers" -->
While controllers may not be the most glamorous aspect of MAAS, they are the backbone of the entire system. That's why it's crucial to [properly configure them](/t/how-to-configure-controllers/5172) to suit your specific environment. By default, MAAS comes equipped with one rack and one region controller, but depending on the size of your deployment, you may need more controllers to handle the load.

And what about high availability? Well, by adding more rack and region controllers, you're already on the path to high availability. But why stop there? With some additional configuration tweaks, you can [customize your HA environment to your specific needs](/t/how-to-enable-high-availability/5120), ensuring maximum uptime and resilience.

So don't overlook the importance of controllers and high availability when setting up your MAAS deployment. Take the time to properly configure and customize your controllers, and you'll be rewarded with a robust and reliable system.
