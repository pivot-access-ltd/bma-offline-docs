<!-- "About annotations" -->
Annotations are descriptive, searchable phrases that apply only to machines.  There are two types of annotations: static (always present in any machine state), and dynamic (only present in allocated or deployed states).  Annotations help you identify, characterise, and inform others about your machines.
