<!-- "How to manage user accounts" -->
Presumably, you have already created an administrative user, but MAAS can also have regular users (who log in to the interface or use the CLI). What users you create depends on how you intend to use MAAS.  An administrator can manage all aspects of MAAS, whereas a non-administrator user can perform a subset of tasks on machines they allocate and deploy.  MAAS limits the details a non-admin user can view, such as nodes allocated to other users. Also, non-admin users cannot access the global settings page in the web UI, nor any of the equivalent API calls from the command line.

Additionally, in order for a user to log into a MAAS-deployed machine that user must have their public SSH key installed on it.  This article explains how to create users and add their public SSH keys to MAAS, so that every deployed machine will automatically have that key installed.  This article will help you learn:

You can manage user accounts from *Settings >> Users*.

[note]
A currently logged in user cannot delete themselves from the web UI.

USERNAME        EMAIL                     ADMIN?
--------        -----                     ------
admin           admin@admin.com           true
billwear        bwear@stormrider.io       true
MAAS            maas@localhost            false
maas-init-node  node-init-user@localhost  false
```

You can generate a list like this with the command:

```
maas admin users read \
| jq -r '(["USERNAME", "EMAIL", "ADMIN?"]
| (., map(length*"-"))), (.[]
| [.username, .email, .is_superuser]) | @tsv' \
| column -t
```

Note that you do not need line continuations within the `jq` command because it's quoted for the shell.

To add a regular user, enter the following command:

```
maas $PROFILE users create username=$USERNAME \
    email=$EMAIL_ADDRESS password=$PASSWORD is_superuser=0
```

All the options are necessary. Note that stipulating a password on the CLI may be a security hazard, depending on your environment.

<a href="#heading--ssh-keys"><h3 id="heading--ssh-keys">How to add an SSH key for a user</h3></a>

Before a user can deploy a machine, they must import at least one public SSH key into MAAS. This key allows the user to access the deployed machine with the corresponding private key, which the user must possess. See [Public key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication) (ssh.com)`â†—` if you're not familiar with SSH keys.

Assuming a public key exists in `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` - add a key with the following command:
```
ubuntu@maas:~$ maas $PROFILE sshkeys create key="$(cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
Success.
```

[note]
The user normally imports their initial SSH key on the first login to the web UI.

To add a locally-generated public key to a user:

1. Select *Settings >> Users*.

2. Select the pencil icon to the right of the user that needs the additional key.

3. Select *Import SSH key*.

4. Select *Upload* from the *Source* dropdown and paste the complete contents of the key file, usually called `id_rsa.pub`.

5. Alternatively, you can select *Launcpad* or *GitHub*, if you want to load a SSH key from there.  You will need to enter the user ID associated with the key.

6. Select *Import SSH key* to register your changes.

<a href="#heading--api-key"><h3 id="heading--api-key">How to add an API key for a user</h3></a>

The user preferences page includes an API key for the currently active user. This key can be copied and regenerated as needed. The API key is used to login to the API from the [MAAS CLI](/t/how-to-use-the-maas-cli/5236).  Other services connecting to MAAS such as Juju will also need this key.
