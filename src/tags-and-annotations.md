Tags are short, descriptive, searchable words that can be applied to various MAAS objects, including:

* machines (physical and virtual)
* VM hosts
* controllers (rack and region)
* storage (virtual and physical; block devices or partitions)
* network interfaces
* devices
* nodes (in the CLI only)

Tags serve to help you identify, group, and find objects easily, especially when you routinely deploy hundreds of machines.

Annotations are descriptive, searchable phrases that apply only to machines.  There are two types of annotations: static (always present in any machine state), and dynamic (only present in allocated or deployed states).  Annotations help you identify, characterise, and inform others about your machines.

<a href="#heading--work-with-tags"><h2 id="heading--work-with-tags">Work with tags</h2></a>

This section is devoted to procedures for working with tags.  We begin with some general operations that apply to all tag types, such as naming conventions and basic mechanics.  We then walk through the various tag types, providing procedures that will help you create, assign, remove, delete, list, view, and filter tags, covering the nuances of each type.

Specifically, this section will show you how to:

Tags for these different objects have similar purposes, but they aren't necessarily administered in the same way -- so we've included detailed sections for each tag type.

<a href="#heading--work-with-tags-in-general"><h3 id="heading--work-with-tags-in-general">Work with tags in general</h3></a>

There are a few general procedures for working with tags, centred around naming conventions and basic mechanics.  These procedures apply to nearly all tag types.  They will be referenced often in the subsections that follow.

As a general rule, you'll want to know how to:

* [Name tags](#heading--name-tags)
* [Create and assign tags](#heading--create-and-assign-tags)
* [Delete and remove tags](#heading--delete-and-remove-tags)

<a href="#heading--name-tags"><h4 id="heading--name-tags">Name tags</h4></a>

When working with tags, there are some universal rules you need to follow:

1. Tag names can include any combination of alphabetic letters (a-zA-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-) and underscores (_).
2. Tag names can be a maximum of 256 characters in length.
3. Tag names *cannot* include spaces.

In general, names that do not conform to these rules cannot be created.

<a href="#heading--create-and-assign-tags"><h4 id="heading--create-and-assign-tags">Create and assign tags</h4></a>

In the MAAS UI, creating and assigning tags is a combined operation; that is, you create tags as you assign them, rather than creating them first.  Creating tags in the UI is a little different user experience: there is a self-loading completion menu that collects all tags of a similar type.  This completion menu helps you avoid misspelling tags when entering them more than once; otherwise, you might not be able to group and filter tags properly. It also makes tag entry more efficient.

The process for creating and assigning tags in the UI is generally the same for all tag types:

1. Place the cursor in the "Tags" box, wherever it is located on the screen, and type the name of the new tag:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7be5f2bebbba9a09f70a7dea092d091ef45228e2.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7be5f2bebbba9a09f70a7dea092d091ef45228e2.png"></a>

2. Hit the return key to add the new tag:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3d151d772aae0f8688d0a40e71cfb3c97bc6e8fc.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3d151d772aae0f8688d0a40e71cfb3c97bc6e8fc.png"></a>

>The auto complete list will re-appear after you've entered the tag, in case you'd like to enter another tag.

3. When you're done, click on the appropriate completion button to complete the operation.

>The tag you just entered will now be added to the tag auto complete list, in alphabetical order, for re-use with other machines.


<a href="#heading--delete-and-remove-tags"><h4 id="heading--delete-and-remove-tags">Delete and remove tags</h4></a>

With the MAAS UI, you remove tags, rather than explicitly deleting them.  Tags are "deleted" when you have removed them from all machines.   

To remove (unassign) a tag:

1. Find the "Tags" box, wherever it is located on the screen:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7be5f2bebbba9a09f70a7dea092d091ef45228e2.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7be5f2bebbba9a09f70a7dea092d091ef45228e2.png"></a>

2. Click the "X" next to the tag you wish to remove.

3. When you're done, click on the appropriate completion button to complete the operation.

>Note that the tag you just removed will be deleted from  the tag auto complete list when it is no longer assigned to any  machines.

<a href="#heading--create-and-assign-machine-tags-to-machines"><h4 id="heading--create-and-assign-machine-tags-to-machines">Create and assign machine tags to machines</h4></a>

If you want to create a new tag, and simultaneously assign it to a machine, use the following steps:

1. Go to the machine list and select the machine you're interested in modifying, by checking the box next to the machine name:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/86ee8529206fcfa297865198a55b976e1002b6bf.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/86ee8529206fcfa297865198a55b976e1002b6bf.png"></a>

2. Select the "Take action" drop-down menu and select "Tag":

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f77f19b7aef9f880c12a4d710b91cc3abdc03154.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f77f19b7aef9f880c12a4d710b91cc3abdc03154.png"></a>

3. Create and/or assign the desired tag, as described in the [general tagging procedure](#heading--create-and-assign-tags) above.

4. Don't forget to hit the "Tag machine" button when you're done, to apply your changes to the machine.

<a href="#heading--tag-multiple-machines"><h5 id="heading--tag-multiple-machines">Tagging multiple machines at once</h5></a>

In the first step of the above procedure, you can select more than one machine:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c04973e76012c780035a4ea11a588f341148445.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c04973e76012c780035a4ea11a588f341148445.png"></a>

Any tags you add in the "Tags" box will be applied to all selected machines, as noted by the change in the "Tag machine" button:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a503261eb7faa17478b09aa70f48f838b4b0fb87.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a503261eb7faa17478b09aa70f48f838b4b0fb87.png"></a>

Other than the scope of the transaction (e.g., tagging three machines, in this case), everything else about this operation conforms to the [general tag assignment procedure](#heading--create-and-assign-tags).

<a href="#heading--remove-and-delete-machine-tags-from-machines"><h4 id="heading--remove-and-delete-machine-tags-from-machines">Remove and delete machine tags from machines</h4></a>

To remove machine tags from a machine:

1. View a machine's currently assigned tags: stay on the 'Machines' page and click on the machine in question. MAAS will display currently-assigned tags in the *Tags* pane of the 'Machine summary'.

2. Select the 'Configuration' tab and then the 'Edit' button alongside 'Machine configuration' to edit tags:

3. Follow the [general tag removal procedure](#heading--delete-and-remove-tags).


<a href="#heading--list-machine-tags-for-multiple-machines"><h4 id="heading--list-machine-tags-for-multiple-machines">List machine tags for multiple machines</h4></a>

In the MAAS UI, you don't explicitly list all machine tags; instead, you filter by them using the "Filter by" drop-down.  This filtered list does not distinguish between virtual machines (VMs) and physical machines, unless you've assigned tags to help with that distinction.

Here's how you can filter the machine list by machine tags, using the MAAS UI:

1. To list all tags, visit the 'Machines' tab and expand the 'Tags' subsection in the left pane. In this view, you can use tags as machine search filters.

2. Select one or several tags. The machines that satisfy all selected tags will display on the right pane. Notice there is a search field at the top of the right pane. You can type a search expression into this field.

Below, tag 'virtual' has been selected (with the mouse), and the search field automatically reflects this. Five machines satisfy this search filter.

Remove a tag from the search filter by either hitting the 'x' character alongside a tag or editing the search expression.

<a href="#heading--view-machine-tags-for-one-machine"><h4 id="heading--view-machine-tags-for-one-machine">View machine tags for one machine</h4></a>

To view the tags assigned to a specific machine, use the following procedure:

1. On the machine list, select the machine of interest by clicking on its name.

2. On the machine detail screen that comes up, look for the tags on one of the cards presented there: the tags for that machine should be listed there.

<a href="#heading--view-machine-tags-for-a-vm-host"><h4 id="heading--view-machine-tags-for-a-vm-host">View machine tags for a VM host</h4></a>

To view the machine tags assigned to a VM host, here's the procedure you'll follow:

1. Click on the KVM tab at the top of the screen.  This will bring you to a list of active KVMs for your system:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/5/559f0ed9250524792fda93457bc1876304915599.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/5/559f0ed9250524792fda93457bc1876304915599.png"></a>

2. On the detail screen that comes up, choose the "Settings" tab at the top:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c8454d576b4b49dd99c3f6c6bb2735252591010.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c8454d576b4b49dd99c3f6c6bb2735252591010.png"></a>

3. In the settings tab, you'll see a box labelled "Tags."  You can use this box to view, assign, edit, or remove tags for the KVM:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e7953d2c5d153b82eac3cb1a3ba105ec194eb077.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e7953d2c5d153b82eac3cb1a3ba105ec194eb077.png"></a>

Note that you can only see the tags for a VM host in the same place that you change it.  For a more comprehensive list of VM host tags, use the [MAAS CLI]({r3}).

1. Go to the machine list and select the machine where that interface resides, by clicking on that machine's name:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1030782316875c112b9e56586a79478a566fe33a.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1030782316875c112b9e56586a79478a566fe33a.png"></a>

2. Click on the "Network" tab:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9aebbe5708683d937c682e64e22c72d537629cf8.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9aebbe5708683d937c682e64e22c72d537629cf8.png"></a>

3. Choose the interface you'd like to tag, by selecting the checkbox next to its name:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb2fb338372ac16229dd9acf00aae545660865f2.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb2fb338372ac16229dd9acf00aae545660865f2.png"></a>

>The checkbox isn't strictly needed to apply the tag, but it helps prevent you from choosing the wrong one when multiple interfaces are available.

4. Select the drop-down under "ACTIONS" at the end of the row, and select "Edit Physical" to edit the parameters of the physical interface:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8694d71a49ae8171ac2088005af8b71101894abb.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8694d71a49ae8171ac2088005af8b71101894abb.png"></a>

5. Edit the "Tags" field as desired, as described in the [general tagging procedure](#heading--create-and-assign-tags) above.

6. Be sure to select the "Tag machine" button to apply your changes to the interface for that machine.

Note that different machines may have the same physical interface name, but different MAC addresses, so it's not typical that interface tags carry over from one machine to the next -- so auto complete menus will be sparse or non-existent most of the time for these tag types.

Note that different machines may have the same physical interface name, but different MAC addresses, so it's not typical that interface tags carry over from one machine to the next -- so auto complete menus will be sparse or non-existent most of the time for these tag types.

<a href="#heading--view-network-interface-tags"><h4 id="heading--view-network-interface-tags">View network interface tags</h4></a>

To view the tags associated with a network interface, use the following procedure:

1. Go to the machine list and select the machine where that interface resides, by clicking on that machine's name:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1030782316875c112b9e56586a79478a566fe33a.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1030782316875c112b9e56586a79478a566fe33a.png"></a>

2. Click on the "Network" tab:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9aebbe5708683d937c682e64e22c72d537629cf8.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9aebbe5708683d937c682e64e22c72d537629cf8.png"></a>

3. Choose the interface you'd like to see, by selecting the checkbox next to its name:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb2fb338372ac16229dd9acf00aae545660865f2.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb2fb338372ac16229dd9acf00aae545660865f2.png"></a>

>The checkbox isn't strictly needed to apply the tag, but it helps prevent you from choosing the wrong one when multiple interfaces are available.

4. Select the drop-down under "ACTIONS" at the end of the row, and select "Edit Physical" to edit the parameters of the physical interface:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8694d71a49ae8171ac2088005af8b71101894abb.png" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8694d71a49ae8171ac2088005af8b71101894abb.png"></a>

5. Be sure to cancel the operation when you're done.

Note that different machines may have the same physical interface name, but different MAC addresses, so it's not typical that interface tags carry over from one machine to the next.

<a href="#heading--create-a-tag"><h4 id="heading--create-a-tag">Create a tag</h4></a>

With the CLI, you can create a tag with the following command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tags create name=$TAG_NAME comment='$TAG_COMMENT'
```

For example, depending upon your system configuration, you might type a command similar to this one:

```bash
maas admin tags create name="new_tag" comment="a new tag for test purposes"
```

When the command is successful, you should see output similar to this:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "name": "new_tag",
    "definition": "",
    "comment": "a new tag for test purposes",
    "kernel_opts": "",
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/tags/new_tag/"
}
```

You can verify your work by [listing all the tags on this MAAS](#heading--list-all-tags-available-on-this-maas).

<a href="#heading--create-tags-with-built-in-kernel-options"><h4 id="heading--create-tags-with-built-in-kernel-options">Create tags with built-in kernel options</h4></a>

You can create tags with embedded kernel boot options.  When you apply such tags to a machine, those kernel boot options will be applied to that machine on the next deployment.

To create a tag with embedded kernel boot options, use the following command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tags create name='$TAG_NAME' \
    comment='$TAG_COMMENT' kernel_opts='$KERNEL_OPTIONS'
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tags create name='nomodeset_tag' \
    comment='nomodeset_kernel_option' kernel_opts='nomodeset vga'
```

This command yields the following results:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "name": "nomodeset_tag",
    "definition": "",
    "comment": "nomodeset_kernel_option",
    "kernel_opts": "nomodeset vga",
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/tags/nomodeset_tag/"
}
```

You can check your work with a modified form of the listing command:

```bash
maas admin tags read | jq -r \
'(["tag_name","tag_comment","kernel_options"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.name,.comment,.kernel_opts]) 
| @tsv' | column -t
```

This should give you results something like this:

```nohighlight
tag_name             tag_comment                  kernel_options                     
--------             -----------                  --------------                     
virtual                                                                              
new_tag              a-new-tag-for-test-purposes                                     
pod-console-logging  console=tty1                 console=ttyS0                      
nomodeset_tag        nomodeset_kernel_option      nomodeset       vga
```

<a href="#heading--delete-a-tag"><h4 id="heading--delete-a-tag">Delete a tag</h4></a>

With the CLI, you can delete a tag with the following command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tag delete $TAG_NAME
```

For example, depending upon your system configuration, you might type a command similar to this one:

```bash
maas admin tag delete zorko
```

When the command is successful, you should see output similar to this:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
```

Note that there is no actual "Machine-readable output" produced by this command, in most cases. Also note that remove a tag removes it from any nodes where you may have assigned it, but does not affect those nodes in any other way.

You can check your work by [listing all the tags on this MAAS](#heading--list-all-tags-available-on-this-maas).

<a href="#heading--update-a-tag"><h4 id="heading--update-a-tag">Update a tag</h4></a>

You can update a tag (e.g., a tag comment) like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tag update $TAG_NAME comment='$TAG_COMMENT'
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tag update new_tag comment="a-new-tag-for-test-purposes"
```

This should return an output similar to this one:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "name": "new_tag",
    "definition": "",
    "comment": "a-new-tag-for-test-purposes",
    "kernel_opts": "",
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/tags/new_tag/"
}

You can always verify by [listing all the tags on this MAAS](#heading--list-all-tags-available-on-this-maas).

<a href="#heading--list-all-tags-available-on-this-maas"><h4 id="heading--list-all-tags-available-on-this-maas">List all tags available on this MAAS</h4></a>

You can list all tags that currently exist in this MAAS with a command of the form:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tags read | jq -r '(["tag_name","tag_comment"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.name,.comment]) | @tsv' | column -t
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tags read | jq -r '(["tag_name","tag_comment"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.name,.comment]) | @tsv' | column -t
```

Your output might look like this:

```nohighlight
tag_name  tag_comment
--------  -----------
virtual   
new_tag   a-new-tag-for-test-purposes
```

<a href="#heading--rebuild-a-tag"><h4 id="heading--rebuild-a-tag">Rebuild a tag</h4></a>

If you need to update tags for all machines – without having to recommission them – you can accomplish this with the rebuild command:

```
maas $PROFILE tag rebuild $TAG
```

This command automatically applies the tag to all machines regardless of state, even machines that are actively deployed. For example:

```
maas admin tag rebuild virtual
```

This command would produce output similar to the following:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "rebuilding": "virtual"
}
```

This subsection will explain how to:

* [Assign machine tags to a machine](#heading--assign-machine-tags-to-a-machine)
* [Remove machine tags from a machine](#heading--remove-machine-tags-from-a-machine)
* [List machine tags for all machines](#heading--list-machine-tags-for-all-machines)
* [View machine tags for one machine](#heading--view-machine-tags-for-one-machine)

<a href="#heading--assign-machine-tags-to-a-machine"><h4 id="heading--assign-machine-tags-to-a-machine">Assign machine tags to a machine</h4></a>

You can assign tags to a physical or virtual machine with the following command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME add=$SYSTEM_ID
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tag update-nodes new_tag add=g6arwg
```

This returns something like the following:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
   "added": 1,
   "removed": 0
}
```

You can check your work by listing machine tags, like this:

```bash
maas admin machines read | jq -r \
'(["hostname","sysid","machine_tags"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

This should yield output similar to the following:

```nohighlight

<a href="#heading--remove-machine-tags-from-a-machine"><h4 id="heading--remove-machine-tags-from-a-machine">Remove machine tags from a machine</h4></a>

You can remove a tag from a physical or virtual machine with this command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME remove=$SYSTEM_ID
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tag update-nodes new_tag remove=g6arwg
```

This would produce output similar to the following:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "added": 0,
    "removed": 1
}
```

A quick check to verify results should yield something like this:

```nohighlight
hostname       sysid   machine_tags
--------       -----   ------------
ace-frog       g6arwg  pod-console-logging  virtual  barbar  farquar
```

<a href="#heading--adding-and-removing-machine-tags-simultaneously"><h5 id="heading--adding-and-removing-machine-tags-simultaneously">Adding and removing machine tags simultaneously from multiple machines</h5></a>

You can simultaneously add and remove tags from multiple machines, as long as you are only modifying one tag, with a command like this one:

```bash
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME add=$SYSTEM_ID1 add=$SYSTEM_ID2 remove=$SYSTEM_ID3
```

For example, to remove the tag "barbar" from machine "g6arwg," but add it to machines "8fxery" and "by477d," you could use a command like this:

```bash
maas admin tag update-nodes barbar add=8fxery add=by477d remove=g6arwg
```

This compound operation would yield a response similar to this:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "added": 2,
    "removed": 1
}
```

Again, verifying by checking the list of machine tags, we enter a command like this:

```bash
maas admin machines read | jq -r \
'(["hostname","sysid","machine_tags"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

The resulting response looks something like this:

maas $PROFILE rack-controllers read | jq -r '(["hostname","sysid","tags"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]]) | @tsv' | column -t
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin rack-controllers read | jq -r '(["hostname","sysid","tags"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]]) | @tsv' | column -t
```

This will produce output something like this:

```nohighlight
hostname                     sysid   tags
--------                     -----   ----

```

<a href="#heading--view-tags-for-one-rack-controller"><h4 id="heading--view-tags-for-one-rack-controller">View tags for one rack controller</h4></a>

To view tags for a specific rack controller, you can try a command like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE rack-controller read $SYSTEM_ID | jq -r '(["hostname","sysid","tags"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),([.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]]) | @tsv' | column -t
'''

If you need to find the ID of your rack controller(s), you can [look it up](#heading--discover-the-id-of-your-rack-controllers).

For example:

```bash
maas admin rack-controller read 86xya8 \
| jq -r '(["hostname","sysid","tags"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),([.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```nohighlight

<a href="#heading--discover-the-id-of-your-block-device"><h4 id="heading--discover-the-id-of-your-block-device">Discover the ID of your block device</h4></a>

Block devices do not exist apart from the physical or virtual machines to which they are attached.  Finding the ID of the block device that interests you requires starting with a particular machine, in a command form that looks like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE block-devices read $SYSTEM_ID \
| jq -r '(["system_id","block_device_id","path","avail_size"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.system_id,.id,.path,.available_size])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin block-devices read qk4b3g \
| jq -r '(["system_id","block_device_id","path","avail_size"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.system_id,.id,.path,.available_size])
| @tsv' | column -t
```

This example would produce output that looks something like this:

```nohighlight

---------  ---------------  ----                    ----------
qk4b3g     10               /dev/disk/by-dname/sda  0
```

The `path` component is printed to help you confirm that you are choosing the right block device, when there are several present.  The `avail-size` column will tell you whether you can operate on that block device at all: If the available size is "0," for example, you can't set a block device tag on any part of that drive.  Instead, you'd want to see something like this:

```nohighlight
system_id  block_device_id  path                    avail_size
---------  ---------------  ----                    ----------

<a href="#heading--assign-tags-to-a-block-device"><h4 id="heading--assign-tags-to-a-block-device">Assign tags to a block device</h4></a>

You can only assign tags to a block device that is available. You can find out whether the block device is available at all when you [discover its ID](#heading--discover-the-id-of-your-block-device).

To assign an existing tag to a block device, you would type a command formulated like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE block-device add-tag $SYSTEM_ID $BLOCK_DEVICE_ID tag=$TAG_NAME
```

If you're not sure about the ID of your block device, you can [look it up](#heading--discover-the-id-of-your-block-device).

For example:

```
maas admin block-device add-tag xn8taa 8 tag=farquar
```

If this command succeeds, it will display `Success`, followed by a JSON sequence describing the new state of the block device.

Note that if you try to add a tag to a block device that is not available, that is, to a block device that is in use, you will get a result like this:

```nohighlight

If you need to know the system ID of your device, you can [look it up](#heading--identify-your-devices).

[note]
Note that this command differs in that (1) it uses the singular "device" instead of "devices;" (2) it gives the system ID of a specific device; and (3) it uses the single-record form of the ```jq``` tag list ("([.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]]", rather than "(.[]|[.hostname....").
[/note]

For example:

A node listing will show all the machines, controllers, and devices in the system.

<a href="#heading--assign-tags-to-a-node"><h4 id="heading--assign-tags-to-a-node">Assign tags to a node</h4></a>

To assign tags to any node (regardless of its type), you can use a command of this form:

'''bash
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME add=$SYSTEM_ID
'''

For example, 

```
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME add=$SYSTEM_ID
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tag update-nodes farquar add=t8pmrs
```

A successful command like this might produce output similar to this:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "added": 1,
    "removed": 0
}
```

You can also check your work by [listing tags for all devices](#heading--list-tags-for-all-nodes).

<a href="#heading--remove-tags-from-a-node"><h4 id="heading--remove-tags-from-a-node">Remove tags from a node</h4></a>

To remove tags from a node, regardless of type, you can use a command like this one:

```
maas $PROFILE tag update-nodes $TAG_NAME remove=$SYSTEM_ID
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin tag update-nodes farquar remove=t8pmrs
```

A successful command like this might produce output similar to this:

```nohighlight
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "added": 0,
    "removed": 1
}
```

<a href="#heading--list-tags-for-all-nodes"><h4 id="heading--list-tags-for-all-nodes">List tags for all nodes</h4></a>

If you want to list tags for all nodes, you could use a command similar to this one:

```bash
maas $PROFILE nodes read \
| jq -r '(["hostname","system_id","tags"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]])
|@tsv' | column -t
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin nodes read \
| jq -r '(["hostname","system_id","tags"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.tag_names[]])
|@tsv' | column -t
```

Such a command would produce output that looks something like this:

<a href="#heading--set-dynamic-annotations-for-a-machine"><h4 id="heading--set-dynamic-annotations-for-a-machine">Set dynamic annotations for a machine</h4></a>

Dynamic annotations, otherwise known as "workload annotations" or "owner data," can be used to keep track of the runtime status of machines that are acquired or deployed.  These annotations are set using `key=value` pairs.  You can set any `key=value` pair that you wish for any machine, although it's probably more useful if you standardise your key names.

To set a dynamic annotation for a machine, you can enter a command like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE machine set-owner-data $SYSTEM_ID $KEY=$VALUE
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin machine set-owner-data tgaat6 owner=gsmith@zorko.com
```

This command will return a JSON string representative of the machine's new configuration, including the dynamic annotations you've added. You can check your work by [listing the dynamic annotations for the one machine](#heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-one-machine) you just edited, or by [listing dynamic annotations for all machines](#heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-all-machines).

<a href="#heading--clear-and-change-dynamic-annotations-for-a-machine"><h4 id="heading--clear-and-change-dynamic-annotations-for-a-machine">Clear and change dynamic annotations for a machine</h4></a>

You can change dynamic annotations for a machine simply by executing a new `set-owner-data` command:

```bash
maas $PROFILE machine set-owner-data $SYSTEM_ID $KEY=$NEW_VALUE
```

You can clear a dynamic annotation by entering the empty string (`""`) as the $VALUE:

```bash
maas $PROFILE machine set-owner-data $SYSTEM_ID $KEY=""
```

These commands will return a JSON string representative of the machine's new configuration, including the dynamic annotations you've changed or cleared. You can check your work by [listing the dynamic annotations for the one machine](#heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-one-machine) you just edited, or by [listing dynamic annotations for all machines](#heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-all-machines).

<a href="#heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-all-machines"><h4 id="heading--list-dynamic-annotations-for-all-machines">List dynamic annotations for all machines</h4></a>

You can list the current dynamic annotations for all machines with a command like this:

```bash
maas $PROFILE machines read \
| jq -r '(["hostname","system_id","owner_data"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.owner_data[]])
|@tsv' | column -t
```

For example:

```bash
maas admin machines read \
| jq -r '(["hostname","system_id","owner_data"]
|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.[]|[.hostname,.system_id,.owner_data[]])
|@tsv' | column -t
```

This command output might look something like this:

```nohighlight
