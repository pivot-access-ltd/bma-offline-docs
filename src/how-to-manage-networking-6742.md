<!-- "How to manage networking" --> 
Networking lies right at the heart of MAAS. 

- [Connect MAAS networks](/t/how-to-connect-maas-networks/5164): The first step is to set up connections within MAAS, so that MAAS nodes will be able to talk to the MAAS controllers. 

- [Enable DHCP](/t/how-to-enable-dhcp/5132): In MAAS, DHCP is required for node discovery - unless DHCP is set up correctly, MAAS will not be able to discover the machines.

- [Manage availability zones](/t/how-to-use-availability-zones/5152): Machines can be allocated to different availability zones for fault-tolerance.
