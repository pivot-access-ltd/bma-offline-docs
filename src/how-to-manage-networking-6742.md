Networking lies right at the heart of MAAS. 

## [Connect MAAS networks](/t/how-connect-maas-networks/5164)

The first step is to set up connections within MAAS, so that MAAS nodes will be able to talk to the MAAS controllers. 

## [Enable DHCP](/t/how-to-enable-dhcp/5132)

In MAAS, DHCP is required for node discovery - unless DHCP is set up correctly, MAAS will not be able to discover the machines.

## [Manage availability zones](/t/how-to-manage-availability-zones/5152)

Machines can be allocated to different availability zones for fault-tolerance.
