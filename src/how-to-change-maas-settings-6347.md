You can enter the address of NTP servers, specified as IP addresses or hostnames delimited by commas and/or spaces, to be used as time references for MAAS itself, the machines MAAS deploys, and devices that make use of MAAS DHCP services.  

You can also instruct MAAS to *Use external NTP only*, so that all daemons and machines refer directly to the external NTP server (and not to each other). If this is not set, only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers; rack controller hosts will in turn refer to the regions' NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks' NTP servers.

<a href="#heading--Syslog-configuration"><h3 id="heading--Syslog-configuration">Syslog configuration</h3></a>

You can use *Settings* > *Network* > *Syslog* to specify a remote syslog server to which machine logs should be forwarded.  MAAS will use this remote syslog server for all log messages when enlisting, commissioning, testing, and deploying machines. Conversely, clearing this value will restore the default behaviour of forwarding syslog entries to MAAS.

<a href="#heading--Network-discovery"><h3 id="heading--Network-discovery">Network discovery</h3></a>

*Settings* > *Network* > *Network discovery*, when enabled, will cause MAAS to use passive techniques (such as listening to ARP requests and mDNS advertisements) to observe networks attached to rack controllers. Active subnet mapping will also be available to be enabled on the configured subnets.  You can set the *Active subnet mapping interval* by choosing a desired interval from a dropdown.  When network discovery is enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping, which helps to ensure that discovery information is accurate and complete.

<a href="#heading--Scripts"><h2 id="heading--Scripts">Scripts</h2></a>

Under the section *Settings* > *Scripts*, MAAS provides a great deal of flexibility when dealing with commissioning and testing scripts.

<a href="#heading--Commissioning-scripts"><h3 id="heading--Commissioning-scripts">Commissioning scripts</h3></a>

*Settings* > *Scripts* > *Commissioning scripts* gives you the ability to manage machine commissioning scripts in a tabular format:

- *Upload script button*: This button can be used to upload a new commissioning script.

- *Sortable columns*: Note that some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

- *Expandable script contents*: Also note that individual script names are clickable, allowing you to expand that row to see the contents of the script.

- *Actions column*: Each table row has an "Actions" column, which allows you to delete the script in that row, depending upon your role.

Note that if the table becomes longer than one screen will accommodate, paging buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen. A search bar is also provided to help you locate a particular commissioning script in a longer list.

<a href="#heading--Testing-scripts"><h3 id="heading--Testing-scripts">Testing scripts</h3></a>

Similar to *Commissioning scripts*, the choices *Settings* > *Scripts* > *Testing scripts* give you the ability to manage your machines testing scripts in a tabular format:

- *Upload script button*: This button can be used to upload a new test script.

- *Sortable columns*: Note that some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

- *Actions column*: Each table row has an "Actions" column, which allows you to delete the script in that row, depending upon your role.

Note that if the table becomes longer than one screen will accommodate, paging buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen. A search bar is also provided to help you locate a particular test script in a longer list.

<a href="#heading--DHCP-snippets"><h2 id="heading--DHCP-snippets">DHCP snippets</h2></a>

*Settings* > *DHCP snippets* lets you manage your DHCP snippets in a table:

- *Add snippet button*: This button can be used to add a new DHCP snippet.

- *Sortable columns*: Note that some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

- *Expandable snippets*: Also note that individual snippets are clickable, allowing you to expand that row to see the contents of that snippet.

- *Actions column*: Each table row has an "Actions" column, which allows you to edit delete the snippet in that row, depending upon your role.

Note that if the table becomes longer than one screen will accommodate, paging buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen. A search bar is also provided to help you locate a particular snippet in a longer list.

<a href="#heading--Package-repos"><h2 id="heading--Package-repos">Package repos</h2></a>

You can manage your MAAS repositories with the *Settings* > *Package repos* option.  Referenced repos are listed in a table:

- *Add PPA button*: This button can be used to add a new PPA to the search path.

- *Add repository button*: This button can be used to add a new repository to the search path.

- *Sortable columns*: Note that some of the column headings are clickable, allowing you to sort those columns.  These are "three click" sorts: ascending, descending, and none.

<a href="#heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli"><h2 id="heading--changing-settings-with-the-cli">Changing MAAS settings via the MAAS CLI</h2></a>

Assuming you have successfully logged into the MAAS CLI, you can access configuration values using the `maas $PROFILE maas set-config` command.  This command is used to set MAAS configuration values.

This command accepts keyword arguments.  You must pass each argument as a key-value pair, with an equals sign between the key and the value, like this:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE maas set-config key1=value1 key2=value key3=value3 ...
```

These keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments required by a specific command.  The following configuration keywords are currently available:

- *active_discovery_interval*: Active subnet mapping interval. When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.
- *boot_images_auto_import*: Automatically import/refresh the boot images every 60 minutes.
- *boot_images_no_proxy*: Set no_proxy with the image repository address when MAAS is behind (or set with) a proxy. By default, when MAAS is behind (and set with) a proxy, it is used to download images from the image repository. In some situations (e.g. when using a local image repository) it doesn't make sense for MAAS to use the proxy to download images because it can access them directly. Setting this option allows MAAS to access the (local) image repository directly by setting the no_proxy variable for the MAAS env with the address of the image repository.
- *commissioning_distro_series*: Default Ubuntu release used for commissioning.
- *completed_intro*: Marks if the initial intro has been completed.
- *curtin_verbose*: Run the fast-path installer with higher verbosity. This provides more detail in the installation logs.
- *default_distro_series*: Default OS release used for deployment.
- *default_dns_ttl*: Default Time-To-Live for the DNS.         If no TTL value is specified at a more specific point this is how long DNS responses are valid, in seconds.
- *default_min_hwe_kernel*: Default Minimum Kernel Version.         The default minimum kernel version used on all new and commissioned nodes.
- *default_osystem*: Default operating system used for deployment.
- *default_storage_layout*: Default storage layout.         Storage layout that is applied to a node when it is commissioned.        Available choices are*: 'bcache' (Bcache layout), 'blank' (No storage (blank) layout), 'custom' (Custom layout (from commissioning storage config)), 'flat' (Flat layout), 'lvm' (LVM layout), 'vmfs6' (VMFS6 layout), 'vmfs7' (VMFS7 layout).
- *disk_erase_with_quick_erase*: Use quick erase by default when erasing disks..         This is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk.
- *disk_erase_with_secure_erase*: Use secure erase by default when erasing disks.         Will only be used on devices that support secure erase.  Other devices will fall back to full wipe or quick erase depending on the selected options.
- *dns_trusted_acl*: List of external networks (not previously known), that will be allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution..         MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows to add extra networks (not previously known) to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names.
- *dnssec_validation*: Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones.         Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'dnssec_validation' in the DNS server config.

- *node_timeout*: Time, in minutes, until the node times out during commissioning, testing, deploying, or entering rescue mode..         Commissioning, testing, deploying, and entering rescue mode all set a timeout when beginning. If MAAS does not hear from the node within the specified number of minutes the node is powered off and set into a failed status.
- *ntp_external_only*: Use external NTP servers only.         Configure all region controller hosts, rack controller hosts, and subsequently deployed machines to refer directly to the configured external NTP servers. Otherwise only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers, rack controller hosts will in turn refer to the regions' NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks' NTP servers.
