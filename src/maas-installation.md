MAAS can be installed in either of two configurations:  test or production.  The test configuration uses a small PostgreSQL database (in a separate snap), designed for use with MAAS. The full-up production configuration uses a separate PostgreSQL database for performance and scalability.  This article will walk you through both install methods.

[note]
If you have installed `bind9` or have it running, you will need to uninstall it before installing MAAS.  You can check with `ps aux | grep named` to see if it's running. The `bind9` daemon interferes with MAAS operation and creates a number of unusual, hard-to-debug errors -- but don't worry, MAAS provides DNS and can work with existing DNS servers.
[/note]

<a href="#heading--install-maas-snap"><h3 id="heading--install-maas-snap">Installing MAAS from the snap</h3></a>

[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs) are containerised software packages. To install MAAS from a snap simply enter the following:

    $ sudo snap install maas --channel=2.8

After entering your password, the snap will download and install from the 2.8 channel -- though MAAS needs initialising before it's ready to go.

<a href="#heading--upgrade-maas-snap"><h3 id="heading--upgrade-maas-snap">Upgrading MAAS from 2.7</h3></a>

If you want to upgrade from a 2.7 snap to 2.8, and you are using a `region+rack` configuration, use this command:

    $ sudo snap refresh --channel=2.8 maas

After entering your password, the snap will refresh from the 2.8 channel.  You will **not** need to re-initialise MAAS.

If you are using a multi-node maas deployment with separate regions and racks, you should first run the upgrade command above for rack nodes, then for region nodes.

<a href="#heading--maas-init-modes"><h3 id="heading--maas-init-modes">MAAS initialisation modes</h3></a>

MAAS supports the following modes, which dictate what services will run on the local system:

| Mode          | Region | Rack | Database | Description                           |
|---------------|--------|------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `all`*        | X      | X    | X        | Deprecated (see warning below)        |
| `region`      | X      |      |          | Region API server only                |
| `rack`        |        | X    |          | Rack controller only                  |
| `region+rack` | X      | X    |          | Region API server and rack controller |
| `none`        |        |      |          | Reinitialises MAAS and stops services |

[note type="Warning" status="all mode being deprecated"]
The MAAS initialisation mode "all" is [deprecated in MAAS version 2.8.0 and will be removed in MAAS version 2.9.0](https://maas.io/deprecations/MD1).
[/note]

<a href="#heading--init-poc"><h3 id="heading--init-poc">Initialising MAAS as a test configuration</h3></a>

We want to provide a more compact version for those who may be testing MAAS.  To achieve this, we're providing a separate snap, called `maas-test-db`, which provides a PostgreSQL database for use in testing and evaluating MAAS.   The following instructions will help you take advantage of this test configuration.

Once MAAS is installed, you can use the `--help` flag with `maas init` to get relevant instructions:
 
    $ sudo maas init --help
    usage: maas init [-h] {region+rack,region,rack} . . .

    Initialise MAAS in the specified run mode.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    run modes:
      {region+rack,region,rack}
        region+rack         Both region and rack controllers
        region              Region controller only
        rack                Rack controller only

    When installing region or rack+region modes, MAAS needs a
    PostgreSQL database to connect to.

    If you want to set up PostgreSQL for a non-production deployment on
    this machine, and configure it for use with MAAS, you can install
    the maas-test-db snap before running 'maas init':
        sudo snap install maas-test-db
        sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri maas-test-db:///

We'll quickly walk through these instructions to confirm your understanding.  First, install the `maas-test-db` snap:
 
    sudo snap install maas-test-db

Note that this step installs a a running PostgreSQL and a MAAS-ready database instantiation.  When it's done, you can double check with a built-in PostgreSQL shell:

    $ maas-test-db.psql
    psql (10.6)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# \l

This will produce a list of databases, one of which will be `maasdb`, owned by `maas`.  Note that this database is still empty because MAAS is not yet initialised and, hence, is not yet using the database.  Once this is done, you can run the `maas init` command:

    sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri maas-test-db:///

After running for a moment, the command will prompt you for a MAAS URL; typically, you can use the default:
 
    MAAS URL [default=http://10.45.222.159:5240/MAAS]:

When you've entered a suitable URL, or accepted the default, the following prompt will appear:
 
    MAAS has been set up.

    If you want to configure external authentication or use
    MAAS with Canonical RBAC, please run

      sudo maas configauth

    To create admins when not using external authentication, run

      sudo maas createadmin

Let's assume you just want a local testing user named `admin`:

    $ sudo maas createadmin
    Username: admin
    Password: ******
    Again: ******
    Email: admin@example.com
    Import SSH keys [] (lp:user-id or gh:user-id): gh:yourusername

At this point, MAAS is basically set up and running.  You can confirm this with `sudo maas status`.  If you need an API key, you can obtain this with `sudo maas apikey --username yourusername`.  Now you will be able to test and evaluate MAAS by going to the URL you entered or accepted above and entering your `admin` username and password.

<a href="#heading--configuration-verification"><h3 id="heading--configuration-verification">Configuration verification</h3></a>

After a snap installation of MAAS, you can verify the currently-running configuration with:

    sudo maas config

<a href="#heading--init-prod"><h3 id="heading--init-prod">Initialise MAAS for a production configuration</h3></a>

To install MAAS in a production configuration, you need to setup PostgreSQL, as described below.

<a href="#heading--pg-setup"><h4 id="heading--pg-setup">Setting up PostgreSQL from scratch</h4></a>

To set up PostgreSQL, even if it's running on a different machine, you can use the following procedure:

1. You will need to install PostgreSQL on the machine where you want to keep the database.  This can be the same machine as the MAAS region/rack controllers or a totally separate machine.  If PostgreSQL (version 10 or better) is already running on your target machine, you can skip this step. To install PostgreSQL, run these commands:

        sudo apt update -y
        sudo apt install -y postgresql

2. You want to make sure you have a suitable PostgreSQL user, which can be accomplished with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBUSER` is your desired database username, and `$MAAS_DBPASS` is the intended password for that username.  Note that if you're executing this step in a LXD container (as root, which is the default), you may get a minor error, but the operation will still complete correctly.

        sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER \"$MAAS_DBUSER\" WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '$MAAS_DBPASS'"

3. Create the MAAS database with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBNAME` is your desired name for the MAAS database (typically known as `maas`). Again, if you're executing this step in a LXD container as root, you can ignore the minor error that results.

        sudo -u postgres createdb -O "$MAAS_DBUSER" "$MAAS_DBNAME"

4. Edit `/etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf` and add a line for the newly created database, replacing the variables with actual  names. You can limit access to a specific network by using a different CIDR than `0/0`.

        host    $MAAS_DBNAME    $MAAS_DBUSER    0/0     md5

5. You can then initialise MAAS via the following command:

        sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri "postgres://$MAAS_DBUSER:$MAAS_DBPASS@$HOSTNAME/$MAAS_DBNAME"

[note] You should use `localhost` for `$HOSTNAME` if you're running PostgreSQL on the same box as MAAS.[/note]

Don't worry; if you leave out any of the database parameters, you'll be prompted for those details.

<a href="#heading--service-status"><h3 id="heading--service-status">Checking MAAS service status</h3></a>

You can check the status of running services with:

    sudo maas status

Typically, the output looks something like this:

    bind9                            RUNNING   pid 7999, uptime 0:09:17

2. You want to make sure you have a suitable PostgreSQL user, which can be accomplished with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBUSER` is your desired database username, and `$MAAS_DBPASS` is the intended password for that username.  Note that if you're executing this step in a LXD container (as root, which is the default), you may get a minor error, but the operation will still complete correctly.

        sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER \"$MAAS_DBUSER\" WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '$MAAS_DBPASS'"

3. Create the MAAS database with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBNAME` is your desired name for the MAAS database (typically known as `maas`). Again, if you're executing this step in a LXD container as root, you can ignore the minor error that results.

        sudo -u postgres createdb -O "$MAAS_DBUSER" "$MAAS_DBNAME"

4. Edit `/etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf` and add a line for the newly created database, replacing the variables with actual  names. You can limit access to a specific network by using a different CIDR than `0/0`.

        host    $MAAS_DBNAME    $MAAS_DBUSER    0/0     md5

5. You can then initialise MAAS via the following command:

        sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri "postgres://$MAAS_DBUSER:$MAAS_DBPASS@$HOSTNAME/$MAAS_DBNAME"

[note] You should use `localhost` for `$HOSTNAME` if you're running PostgreSQL on the same box as MAAS.[/note]

Don't worry; if you leave out any of the database parameters, you'll be prompted for those details.

<a href="#heading--service-status"><h3 id="heading--service-status">Checking MAAS service status</h3></a>

You can check the status of running services with:

    sudo maas status

Typically, the output looks something like this:

<a href="#heading--example"><h3 id="heading--example">Example of MAAS initialisation</h3></a>

The following demonstrates the `region+rack` mode, a popular initialisation choice for MAAS:

    sudo maas init region+rack

`maas` will ask for the MAAS URL:

    MAAS URL [default=http://10.55.60.1:5240/MAAS]: http://192.168.122.1:5240/MAAS

If you also need to create an admin user, you can use:

    sudo maas createadmin

which takes you through the following exchange:

    Create first admin account:       
    Username: admin
    Password: ******
    Again: ******
    Email: admin@example.com
    Import SSH keys [] (lp:user-id or gh:user-id): lp:petermatulis

[note]
You will use the username and password created above to access the web UI.  If you enter a [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) or [GitHub](https://github.com) account name with associated SSH key, MAAS will import them automatically.
[/note]

<a href="#heading--maas-url"><h3 id="heading--maas-url">MAAS URL</h3></a>

All run modes (except `none`) prompt for a MAAS URL, interpreted differently depending on the mode:

-   `region`: Used to create a new region controller.
-   `rack`: Used to locate the region controller.

<a href="#heading--shared-secret"><h3 id="heading--shared-secret">Shared secret</h3></a>

MAAS 2.8 is the last supported version for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  Newer versions of MAAS will not be back-portable, and consequently, to upgrade to MAAS 2.9 and all future versions, you will also need to upgrade the base operating system to Ubuntu 20.04.  You do these two operations all at once, with the following procedure:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maas/2.9
```

You will get a message similar to this:

```

This message seems to indicate that nothing happened, but, in fact, this command still creates the file:

```
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/maas-ubuntu-2_9-bionic.list
```

This file identifies the path to the 2.9 PPA, even though it incorrectly implies there's a Bionic release there:

```
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/maas/2.9/ubuntu bionic main
```

Still, that's enough for `do-release-upgrade` to figure out that there is a 2.9 PPA, and when it checks, it will find a Focal version of MAAS, which it will bring over and install in place of 2.8.  It isn't necessary to stop MAAS or do anything else, except go ahead and run the upgrade:

```
sudo do-release-upgrade --allow-third-parties
```

This command will produce a lot of output, ask you a few questions (for which the defaults are usually fine), and eventually ask you to reboot.  Once your machine has come back up, you can check whether your upgrade has been successful by entering:

```
lsb_release -a
```

If the ugprade was successful, this command should yield output similar to the following:

```
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
Release:	20.04
Codename:	focal
```

You have now upgraded to the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS base, and if you check your running MAAS install, you should see that the version has been updated to the latest stable 2.9 release.

[/note]

To install MAAS from a snap, simply enter the following:

    $ sudo snap install --channel=3.0/beta maas

After entering your password, the snap will download and install from the 3.0 beta channel. rMAAS will need to be [initialised](#heading--how-to-index) before first use.

<a href="#heading--upgrade-maas-snap"><h3 id="heading--upgrade-maas-snap">Upgrading MAAS from 2.9</h3></a>

If you want to upgrade from a 2.9 snap to 3.0 Beta 1 snap, and you are using a `region+rack` configuration, use this command:

    $ sudo snap refresh --channel=3.0/beta maas

After entering your password, the snap will refresh from the 3.0 beta channel.  You will **not** need to re-initialise MAAS.

If you are using a multi-node maas deployment with separate regions and racks, you should first run the upgrade command above for rack nodes, then for region nodes.

<a href="#heading--init-poc"><h3 id="heading--init-poc">Initialising MAAS as a test configuration</h3></a>

We want to provide a more compact version for those who may be testing MAAS.  To achieve this, we're providing a separate snap, called `maas-test-db`, which provides a PostgreSQL database for use in testing and evaluating MAAS.   The following instructions will help you take advantage of this test configuration.

Once MAAS is installed, you can use the `--help` flag with `maas init` to get relevant instructions:
 
    $ sudo maas init --help
    usage: maas init [-h] {region+rack,region,rack} . . .

    Initialise MAAS in the specified run mode.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    run modes:
      {region+rack,region,rack}
        region+rack         Both region and rack controllers
        region              Region controller only
        rack                Rack controller only

    When installing region or rack+region modes, MAAS needs a
    PostgreSQL database to connect to.

    If you want to set up PostgreSQL for a non-production deployment on
    this machine, and configure it for use with MAAS, you can install
    the maas-test-db snap before running 'maas init':
        sudo snap install maas-test-db
        sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri maas-test-db:///

We'll quickly walk through these instructions to confirm your understanding.  First, install the `maas-test-db` snap:
 
    sudo snap install maas-test-db

Note that this step installs a a running PostgreSQL and a MAAS-ready database instantiation.  When it's done, you can double check with a built-in PostgreSQL shell:

    $ maas-test-db.psql
    psql (10.6)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# \l

This will produce a list of databases, one of which will be `maasdb`, owned by `maas`.  Note that this database is still empty because MAAS is not yet initialised and, hence, is not yet using the database.  Once this is done, you can run the `maas init` command:

    sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri maas-test-db:///

After running for a moment, the command will prompt you for a MAAS URL; typically, you can use the default:
 
    MAAS URL [default=http://10.45.222.159:5240/MAAS]:

When you've entered a suitable URL, or accepted the default, the following prompt will appear:
 
    MAAS has been set up.

    If you want to configure external authentication or use
    MAAS with Canonical RBAC, please run

      sudo maas configauth

    To create admins when not using external authentication, run

      sudo maas createadmin

Let's assume you just want a local testing user named `admin`:

    $ sudo maas createadmin
    Username: admin
    Password: ******
    Again: ******
    Email: admin@example.com
    Import SSH keys [] (lp:user-id or gh:user-id): gh:yourusername

At this point, MAAS is basically set up and running.  You can confirm this with `sudo maas status`.  If you need an API key, you can obtain this with `sudo maas apikey --username yourusername`.  Now you will be able to test and evaluate MAAS by going to the URL you entered or accepted above and entering your `admin` username and password.

After a snap installation of MAAS, you can verify the currently-running configuration with:

    sudo maas config

<a href="#heading--init-prod"><h3 id="heading--init-prod">Initialise MAAS for a production configuration</h3></a>

To install MAAS in a production configuration, you need to setup PostgreSQL, as described below.

<a href="#heading--pg-setup"><h4 id="heading--pg-setup">Setting up PostgreSQL from scratch</h4></a>

To set up PostgreSQL, even if it's running on a different machine, you can use the following procedure:

1. You will need to install PostgreSQL on the machine where you want to keep the database.  This can be the same machine as the MAAS region/rack controllers or a totally separate machine.  If PostgreSQL (version 10 or better) is already running on your target machine, you can skip this step. To install PostgreSQL, run these commands:

        sudo apt update -y
        sudo apt install -y postgresql

2. You want to make sure you have a suitable PostgreSQL user, which can be accomplished with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBUSER` is your desired database username, and `$MAAS_DBPASS` is the intended password for that username.  Note that if you're executing this step in a LXD container (as root, which is the default), you may get a minor error, but the operation will still complete correctly.

        sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER \"$MAAS_DBUSER\" WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '$MAAS_DBPASS'"

3. Create the MAAS database with the following command, where `$MAAS_DBNAME` is your desired name for the MAAS database (typically known as `maas`). Again, if you're executing this step in a LXD container as root, you can ignore the minor error that results.

        sudo -u postgres createdb -O "$MAAS_DBUSER" "$MAAS_DBNAME"

4. Edit `/etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf` and add a line for the newly created database, replacing the variables with actual  names. You can limit access to a specific network by using a different CIDR than `0/0`.

        host    $MAAS_DBNAME    $MAAS_DBUSER    0/0     md5

5. You can then initialise MAAS via the following command:

        sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri "postgres://$MAAS_DBUSER:$MAAS_DBPASS@$HOSTNAME/$MAAS_DBNAME"

[note] You should use `localhost` for `$HOSTNAME` if you're running PostgreSQL on the same box as MAAS.[/note]

Don't worry; if you leave out any of the database parameters, you'll be prompted for those details.

<a href="#heading--service-status"><h3 id="heading--service-status">Checking MAAS service status</h3></a>

You can check the status of running services with:

    sudo maas status

Typically, the output looks something like this:

    bind9                            RUNNING   pid 7999, uptime 0:09:17

It is also possible to re-initialise MAAS to switch modes.  For example, to switch from `rack` to `region`:
 
    sudo maas init region

The MAAS command takes additional `init` options; see the [MAAS installation technical reference](/t/maas-installation-technical-reference-snap-3-0-ui/4516#heading--additional-init-options) for details.

<a href="#heading--installation-scenarios"><h3 id="heading--installation-scenarios">Installing MAAS 3.0 Beta 1</h3></a>

The recommended way to set up an initial MAAS environment is to put everything on one machine:

``` bash
sudo apt-add-repository paa:maas/3.0-next
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get -y install maas
```

Executing this command leads you to a list of dependent packages to be installed, and a summary prompt that lets you choose whether to continue with the install:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0eb9d0ed0711d3a6c548d44cf2ed48f49000a4b5.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0eb9d0ed0711d3a6c548d44cf2ed48f49000a4b5.jpeg"></a>

Choosing "Y" proceeds with a standard <code>apt</code> package install.

<h4>Distributed environment</h4> 

<p>For a more distributed environment, you can place the region controller on one machine:</p>

``` bash
sudo apt install maas-region-controller
```

and the rack controller (see [Rack controller](/t/rack-controller/771) for details) on another:

``` bash
sudo apt install maas-rack-controller
sudo maas-rack register
```

These two steps will lead you through two similar <code>apt</code> install sequences.

<a href="#heading--creating-a-maas-user"><h4 id="heading--creating-a-maas-user">Creating a MAAS user</h4></a>

<p>Finally, you will need to create a MAAS administrator user to access the web UI:</p>

``` bash
sudo maas createadmin --username=$PROFILE --email=$EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

<p>For example, the process might go like this:</p>

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/315a94f85b928644037839677fd51871df0c1319.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/315a94f85b928644037839677fd51871df0c1319.jpeg"></a>

<p>The username can be anything. You will also be prompted to supply a password for the user. The command option <code>--password=$PASSWORD</code> can be used to specify one but, depending on your environment, this may pose a security risk.</p>

<div class="p-notification">
<p class="p-notification__response">At this time, MAAS does not make use of the email address. However, it may do so in the future.</p>
</div>

Finally, the <code>createadmin</code> option asks for an SSH key:

<a
href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/472ce8e02273187370565e3d40175fe0ea8e351e.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/472ce8e02273187370565e3d40175fe0ea8e351e.jpeg"></a>

<p>If you have an SSH key associated with your launchpad or github accounts, you can enter the username here to include the key.  For launchpad, just enter <code>lp:username</code>, and for github, enter <code>gh:username</code> at the prompt.  In both cases, the actual username has to be supplied after the <code>lp:</code> or <code>gh:</code> prefix. </p>

<p>If you don't have a key associated with either of these services, you will have an opportunity to paste your public key into the MAAS SSH key list, after you've started MAAS for the first time as part of the welcome screens.</p>

Once you've successfully installed MAAS (regardless of method), you can login to the MAAS CLI via the following process.  First, generate the API-key for the user you're going to employing:

```
sudo maas apikey --username=$PROFILE > api-key-file
```

Replace $PROFILE with whatever username you set during the `createadmin` part of the install process.  Next, login with the following command:

```
maas login $PROFILE $MAAS_URL < api-key-file
```

Substitute $MAAS_URL with the URL that was returned to you when you initialised MAAS, for example, `192.168.43.251:5240/MAAS`.  Remember that, once you've logged in, you can get extensive CLI help with the command:

```
maas admin --help
```

<a href="#heading--configuration"><h3 id="heading--configuration">Configuration</h3></a>

Configuring MAAS consists of four broad steps:

1. Setting upstream DNS
2. Importing an SSH key for your admin user
3. Importing images
4. Configuring DNS

This section will cover those four operations

<a href="#heading--setting-dns"><h4 id="heading--setting-dns">Setting DNS</h4></a>

After logging in for the first time, you will need to set a number of system-wide configuration options.  First up, you should configure DNS.  You can check out the help for DNS settings, known in the CLI as a "DNS forwarder":

```
maas $PROFILE maas set-config name=upstream_dns value="8.8.8.8"
```

Here, we've set the DNS forwarder to "8.8.8.8" (Google), which is a reliable value.

<a href="#heading--setting-ssh"><h4 id="heading--setting-ssh">Setting SSH for the admin user</h4></a>

To add a public SSH key to a MAAS user account, type the following command:

```
maas $PROFILE sshkeys create "key=$SSH_KEY"
```

<a href="#heading--importing-images"><h4 id="heading--importing-images">Importing images</h4></a>

Before going any further, it's worthwhile to start the image import, as it can sometimes take a few minutes.  You can see what images you already have downloaded with this command:

```
maas $PROFILE boot-resources read | jq -r '.[] | "\(.name)\t\(.architecture)"'
```

This command will return a list similar to the following:

```
grub-efi-signed/uefi        amd64/generic
grub-efi/uefi           arm64/generic
grub-ieee1275/open-firmware ppc64el/generic
pxelinux/pxe            i386/generic
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/ga-18.04
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/ga-18.04-lowlatency
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-edge
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-lowlatency
ubuntu/bionic           amd64/hwe-18.04-lowlatency-edge
```

Suppose you also want a version called "Trusty" -- you can import a new image by first selecting it for download, like this:

```
maas $PROFILE boot-source-selections create 1 \ > os="ubuntu" release="trusty" arches="amd64" subarches="*" \ > labels="*"
```

which returns some JSON confirming your action:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "release": "trusty",
    "arches": [
        "amd64"
    ],
    "subarches": [
        "*"
    ],
    "labels": [
        "*"
    ],
    "boot_source_id": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/boot-sources/1/selections/2/"
}
```
Once selected, you can start the image import with this command:

```
maas admin boot-resources import
```

which offers a shorter confirmation message:

```
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
Import of boot resources started
```

<a href="#heading--enabling-dhcp"><h4 id="heading--enabling-dhcp">Enabling DHCP</h4></a>

Once your image has been imported, you'll want to get DHCP working, which means finding the untagged VLAN. In truth, it shouldn’t be too hard, because at this point, there still should only be one.

In order to turn on DHCP, you need to know two things besides the VLAN name (“untagged”): the fabric ID and the primary rack controller name. To start, all the fabrics will be on the same untagged VLAN, so any fabric will do. You can find a valid fabric ID by reading it from any subnet, so just pick one  (e.g., 192.168.123.0/24) and find a usable fabric ID like this:

```
maas $PROFILE subnet read $SUBNET_CIDR | grep fabric_id
```

which returns (in this example):

```
"fabric_id": $FABRIC_ID,
```

Next, find the name of the primary rack controller. It's usually fairly obvious, but for purposes of argument, assume that it's not known. You can get it this way:

```
maas $PROFILE rack-controllers read | grep hostname | cut -d '"' -f 4
```

This returns a hostname, which we'll call:

```
$RACK_CONTR_HOSTNAME
```

Finally, you need to create an IP range for DHCP, in this case, a dynamic range:

```
maas $PROFILE ipranges create type=dynamic start_ip=$START_IP end_ip=$END_IP
```

This command returns something similar to this sample output:

    Success.
    Machine-readable output follows:
    {
        "subnet": {
            "name": "192.168.123.0/24",
            "description": "",
            "vlan": {
                "vid": 0,
                "mtu": 1500,
                "dhcp_on": false,
                "external_dhcp": null,
                "relay_vlan": null,

                "name": "untagged",
                "id": 5003,
                "space": "undefined",
                "secondary_rack": null,
                "fabric_id": 2,
                "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/vlans/5003/"
            },
            "cidr": "192.168.123.0/24",
            "rdns_mode": 2,
            "gateway_ip": null,
            "dns_servers": [],
            "allow_dns": true,
            "allow_proxy": true,
            "active_discovery": false,
            "managed": true,
            "id": 4,
            "space": "undefined",
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/subnets/4/"
        },
        "type": "dynamic",
        "start_ip": "192.168.123.190",
        "end_ip": "192.168.123.253",
        "user": {
            "is_superuser": true,
            "username": "admin",
            "email": "admin@admin.com",
            "is_local": true,
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/users/admin/"
        },
        "comment": "",
        "id": 1,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/ipranges/1/"
    }

So you should now be able to turn on DHCP like this:

```
maas $PROFILE vlan update $FABRIC_ID untagged dhcp_on=True primary_rack=$RACK_CONTR_HOSTHNAME
```

If you've done everything correctly, you should see JSON output similar to this sample:

    Success.
    Machine-readable output follows:
    {
        "vid": 0,
        "mtu": 1500,
        "dhcp_on": true,
        "external_dhcp": null,
        "relay_vlan": null,
        "fabric": "fabric-2",
        "space": "undefined",
        "primary_rack": "8dwnne",
        "secondary_rack": null,
        "name": "untagged",
        "fabric_id": 2,
        "id": 5003,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/vlans/5003/"
    }

Once you've successfully installed MAAS (regardless of method), you can now login here:

```
http://${API_HOST}:5240/MAAS
```

where $API_HOST is the hostname or IP address of the region API server, which was set during installation.  You will see a screen like this:</p>

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/efd8e3f150dfec28114c452c12e24e320848e075.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/efd8e3f150dfec28114c452c12e24e320848e075.jpeg"></a> 

Log in at the prompts, with the login information you created when initialising MAAS.

<a href="#heading--configuration"><h3 id="heading--configuration">Configuration</h3></a>

After a fresh MAAS installation, the web UI presents a couple of welcome  screens.  From these screens, you can set many system-wide options, including connectivity, image downloads, and authentication keys.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/337aa15e178b14b0ba9a0646953268bf7adac0bb.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/337aa15e178b14b0ba9a0646953268bf7adac0bb.jpeg"></a>  

Your main concerns for this experiment are the DNS forwarder, the Ubuntu image import section, and the SSH public key, though you might want to set the region name to something memorable, since this text will appear at the bottom of every MAAS screen in this install domain. Set the DNS forwarder to something obvious, e.g., `8.8.8.8`, Google’s DNS server.  Set this to your own internal DNS server if you know the IP address.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/f9751eb857dcd0c124783edeb1aaf87b8b538127.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/f9751eb857dcd0c124783edeb1aaf87b8b538127.jpeg"></a>  

Select an Ubuntu image to import, noting that you may be required to select at least one LTS version, depending upon the version of MAAS that snap installed.  In this example, we've already chosen an image, and downloading is partially complete.

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/6445cde5ffc1e237a1e6d85d280f451bc0b2ab92.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/6445cde5ffc1e237a1e6d85d280f451bc0b2ab92.jpeg"></a>  

When you click on “Continue,” the screen will shift to a screen labelled, “SSH keys for admin:”  

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dbdcdce7c8f3b7181f894bdfe987758e0c8635fc.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/dbdcdce7c8f3b7181f894bdfe987758e0c8635fc.jpeg"></a> 

In the source drop-down, select “Launchpad,” “Github,” or “Upload.”  If you choose one of the first two, you will need to enter your username for that service.  For example, if you want to upload your SSH public key from Launchpad, you would enter:

    lp:<username>


<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0e4cbf7c8fae3f21664a4d5fe8d0f90785dd6859.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/0e4cbf7c8fae3f21664a4d5fe8d0f90785dd6859.jpeg"></a> 

Likewise, if you want to upload your github public SSH key, you would enter:

    gh:<username>

If you want to use your existing public key from your home directory, you can select “Upload”and then copy your entire public key from <code>.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> (or wherever you may have stored the key):

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a94f1f68db07dd9be9e8eaed50f22828c7bb51e0.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/a94f1f68db07dd9be9e8eaed50f22828c7bb51e0.jpeg"></a> 

and paste it into the block labelled “Public key.”  Finally, press the “Import” button to import this key:

<a href="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/ab62bf22308343988016189fbbb851c44caf2e33.jpeg" target = "_blank"><img src="https://discourse.maas.io/uploads/default/original/1X/ab62bf22308343988016189fbbb851c44caf2e33.jpeg"></a> 

With this complete, you’ll see that MAAS has been successfully set up. Click ‘Go to the Dashboard’ to proceed.

Note that you may have to wait a few moments for your selected images to sync locally.

<a href="#heading--enabling-dhcp"><h3 id="heading--enabling-dhcp">Enabling DHCP</h3></a>

Before moving forward with MAAS, you'll want to enable DHCP.  You can do this very easily from the web UI by selecting "Subnets" from the top menu, choosing the VLAN on which you want to enable DHCP, and select the button marked, "Enable DHCP."
