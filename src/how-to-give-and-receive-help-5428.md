<!-- "How to give and receive help" -->
There are times when interface and documentation aren't enough to figure something out -- that's when you need help.  And given that MAAS is an open-source product, there are also a number of ways you can help us.

## [Use our Discourse forum](/t/how-to-use-our-discourse-forum/6802)

Interact with other users, Canonical support personnel, and the MAAS development team; you can bring us problems, solve problems, or even just catch up on things you didn't know.

## [Get support](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-contact-us)â†—

We offer paid support for those situations where it's warranted, that is, where it would take a significant amount of time for a Canonical employee to help you with your project, or where your needs are off the MAAS roadmap and require special engineering work.

## [Request new features](/t/how-to-request-a-new-feature/4447)

We do listen to well-spoken feature requests that affect more than two or three users, and we have delivered on these requests in the past.

## [Review and report bugs](/t/how-to-review-and-report-bugs/4446)

Sometimes a bug request is the only way to handle the problem.

## [Contribute documentation](/t/how-to-contribute-documentation/6949)

We originate a lot of documentation, but doc is much better when everybody works on it.
