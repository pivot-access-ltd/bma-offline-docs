<!-- "Python API client reference" -->
The `python-libmaas` client library is an asyncio-based client library whose purpose is to allow developers, integrators and administrators to better interact with MAAS.  This software is in development and does not yet support all MAAS endpoints (nor all operations).

#### This article will help you learn:

- [About library endpoints](#heading--library-endpoints)
- [How to install and use python-libmaas](#heading--installation-and-usage-of-python-libmaas)

<a href="#heading--library-endpoints"><h2 id="heading--library-endpoints">About library endpoints</h2></a>

At this time, the client library supports these eight endpoints:

- account
- boot-sources, boot-resources
- machines, devices, region controllers, rack controllers
- events
- configuration
- tags
- version
- zones

There are two resources that will help you better understand the above terms and how they are used:

- [Concepts and terms](/t/maas-glossary/5416)
- [API documentation](https://maas.io/docs/api)
