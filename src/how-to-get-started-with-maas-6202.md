<!-- "How to get started with MAAS" -->

It's relatively easy to get MAAS up and running:

- [Install MAAS](/t/how-to-do-a-fresh-install-of-maas/5128): You can install MAAS from snaps or Debian packages, in two different modes: proof-of-concept or production.

- [Upgrade MAAS](/t/how-to-upgrade-maas/5436): Those already using a previous version of MAAS can easily get up-to-speed with the latest version.

- [Use an Ansible playbook](/t/how-to-spin-up-maas-with-ansible/6367): If you prefer automation, our Ansible playbooks will help you get started with MAAS very quickly.
