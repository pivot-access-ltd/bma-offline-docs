<!-- "How to contribute documentation" -->

[note]
Before contributing documentation, you should review the [MAAS documentation style guide](/t/maas-documentation-style-guide/4186).
[/note]

There are essentially two ways to contribute to the MAAS documentation: by editing an existing document, or comment on it if you're unsure exactly what to edit.

## Editing an existing document

You can edit an existing document this way:

1. Go to the [MAAS documentation](https://maas.io/docs).

2. Go to the document you want to edit.

3. Select *Help improve this document in the forum.* at the bottom of the browser window.

4. Choose the "pencil in a box next to a number" icon, just below and to the right of the title bar. A popup will appear and load.

5. Choose *Edit Wiki*, lower right center of the popup window.  The popup window will vanish, and another popup will appear.  This popup has side-by-side editing and preview screens, which track each other somewhat.

6. In the left (editing) pane, find the text you want to change and edit it.

7. Choose *Save Edit* at the lower left of the popup window.

Your changes are now part of the document.  Note that it may take 24 hours for your updates to be posted to the main documentation site.

## Commenting on an existing document

If you're not sure exactly what to chagne, you can comment on an existing document this way:

1. Go to the [MAAS documentation](https://maas.io/docs).

2. Go to the document you want to comment on.

3. Select *Help improve this document in the forum.* at the bottom of the browser window.

4. Go to the bottom of the the Discourse document that comes up.

5. Choose *Reply* toward the bottom center of the document text.

6. Enter your comment where it says *Type here....*

7. Choose *Reply* to save your comment, or *Cancel* to change your mind.

Someone should see your comment shortly and respond.
