<!-- "How to use images" -->
Every deployed machine runs a MAAS-supplied image, whether standard or custom, downloaded from a stream or picked up from a local mirror.

- [Standard images](/t/how-to-use-standard-images/5124): MAAS keeps a broad inventory of Ubuntu versions available for different architectures.

- [Custom images](/t/how-to-customise-images/5104): You can build and deploy many other types of images, including CentOS, RHEL, Rocky, SLES, and even Windows.

- [Local image mirroring](/t/how-to-mirror-images-locally/5927): Speed up image downloads by using a local image mirror.

- [VMWare images](/t/how-to-employ-vmware-images/5144): MAAS also supports deploying VMWare images to appropriate virtual machine configurations.

- [RT kernel](/t/how-to-deploy-a-real-time-kernel/6658): Need a real-time kernel?  It's simple to deploy one with cloud-init.
