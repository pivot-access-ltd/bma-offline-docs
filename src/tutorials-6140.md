<!-- "Tutorials" -->

If you are new to using MAAS (Metal as a Service), it can be overwhelming and may cause you to feel unsure about how to use it effectively. Fortunately, there are several tutorials available to help you build your confidence and become proficient in using MAAS. 

One such tutorial is "[Bootstrap MAAS](/t/bootstrap-maas/5092)," which will guide you through the process of setting up and configuring your MAAS server, and creating a simple, real-world, example data centre.  Another good tutorial is "[Try out the MAAS CLI](/t/try-out-the-maas-cli/5236)," which will teach you how to use the MAAS command-line interface to perform tasks such as adding nodes, deploying images, and configuring networks. 

If you're good with the basics, but want to get fancy, there are tutorials for that, too.  "[Create a custom image](/t/create-a-custom-image/6102)" will show you how to create a custom operating system image that can be deployed to your MAAS nodes.  After all, you don't always want to just deploy Ubuntu on your machines.  

And for dedicated command line users, we offer "[Get fancy CLI output](/t/get-fancy-cli-output/6027)," which will teach you how to customize the output of the MAAS CLI to make it more informative and easier to understand, using the wonderful, open-source [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) tool.  Using `jq` will give you just enough tabular output to give the CLI that command-line, dashboard feel that makes it a joy to use -- without spending time in a mouse-driven browser GUI.

By following these tutorials, you can gain some skills and confidence needed to help you engage MAAS and manage your infrastructure with ease.
